Davis studied at Henri’s New York school, but he eventually came to disagree with his teacher’s belief in the preeminence of content over composition and form; instead, he created a style in which he generalized and abstracted his shapes and the spaces between them.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Davis’s art is never totally abstract. Twentieth-century America is reflected in the shapes and colors he chose and in the sheer vitality of his compositions. His style—big, bright, bold, and clear—is completely appropriate to his subject matter. Forms have been reduced to large colored planes; words or numbers are simplified and offered as elements of design. In <em>Ready-to-Wear</em>, the bright, unmixed colors recall those of the French artist Fernand Léger. The way in which they intersect and interrupt one another, however, conveys a mood that is distinctly American: energetic, jazzy, mass produced—all qualities summed up in the title. The planes, reminiscent of overlapping pasted-down paper cutouts, even suggest the garment patterns from which ready-to-wear clothes are assembled.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"142.6 × 106.7 cm (56 1/8 × 42 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":106.7,"width_in":42,"height_cm":142.6,"height_in":56.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed l. right: Stuart Davis","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mr. and Mrs. Sigmund W.

He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed &quot;faked, absurd, delicious!&quot; <em>Interior at Nice</em> is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition’s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea. Framed by shimmering curtains, she gazes directly at the viewer.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"131.5 × 90.7 cm (51 13/16 × 35 11/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":90.7,"width_in":35.6875,"height_cm":131.5,"height_in":51.8125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"Henri-Matisse\"","credit_line":"Gift of Mrs. Gilbert W.

But critics and the public did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects; they called him the “apostle of ugliness.”</p>\n<p>The ample, demurely dressed subject of <em>Mère Grégoire</em> was inspired by the heroine of a popular song written in the 1820s by French lyricist Pierre-Jean Béranger. Béranger often penned ribald lyrics; his “Madame Grégoire” was the proprietor of a house of prostitution. Courbet depicted the woman here in the midst of a transaction, with coins scattered on a marble-topped counter and a ledger beneath her right hand. Under her other hand is the small bell she uses to summon one of her female employees. She presumably offers an unseen customer a flower, a symbol of love.</p>\n<p>The painting may also have had a political subtext. Béranger and Courbet were fierce opponents of the monarchy and the Second Empire, respectively. In the mid-1850s, when Courbet began his portrait of Mère Grégoire, the government harshly attacked the songs of the popular writer as part of an effort to restrict free expression. Courbet’s decision to portray Béranger’s Madame Grégoire, whose flower exhibits the blue, white, and red of the French flag, may represent a protest not only against government censorship but also against the Second Empire itself, making the subject of this painting into a heroine embodying the rights to freedom in life and love that were forbidden under a repressive regime.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"129 × 97.5 cm (50 3/4 × 38 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":97.5,"width_in":38.375,"height_cm":129,"height_in":50.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed, lower left, on counter: G.

According to the biblical story, when her city was besieged by the Assyrian army, the beautiful young widow gained access to the quarters of the general Holofernes. After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head.</p>\n<p>Van Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag. The interplay between the straining pose of the figure, the dramatic lighting, and the fastidiously recorded surfaces serves to heighten the tension of this composition.</p>\n","short_description":"According to the biblical story, the widow Judith saved her people from slaughter by the Assyrian army by infiltrating the tent of the enemy general, Holofernes, to seduce and then behead him. Dutch painter Jan van Hemessen's life-size interpretation reflects contemporary male ambivalence toward female agency in 16th-century Netherlands. It celebrates Judith's physical and moral strength but also foregrounds the sexuality that enabled her triumph.","dimensions":"99.1 × 77.2 cm (39 × 30 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":77.2,"width_in":30.375,"height_cm":99.1,"height_in":39,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Wirt D.

In his powerful, nihilistic works, tormented and deformed figures become players in dark, unresolved dramas. Bacon often referred in his paintings to the history of art, interpreting borrowed images through his own bleak mentality. <em>Figure with Meat</em> is part of a now-famous series he devoted to Diego Velázquez’s <em>Portrait of Pope Innocent X</em> (c. 1650; Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome). Here he transformed the Spanish Baroque artist’s iconic portrayal of papal authority into a nightmarish image, in which the blurred figure of the pope, seen as if through a veil, seems trapped in a glass-box torture chamber, his mouth open in a silent scream. Instead of the noble drapery that frames Velázquez’s pope, Bacon is flanked by two sides of beef, quoting the work of seventeenth-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn and twentieth-century Russian artist Chaim Soutine, both of whom painted brutal and haunting images of raw meat. Framed by the carcass, Bacon’s pope can be seen alternately as a depraved butcher, or as much a victim as the slaughtered animal hanging behind him.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Without frame: 129.9 × 121.9 cm (51 3/16 × 48 in.); 129.9 × 122 cm (51 1/8 × 48 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":121.9,"width_in":47.9922,"height_cm":129.9,"height_in":51.1418,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Without frame"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":122,"width_in":48,"height_cm":129.9,"height_in":51.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"No known inscriptions","credit_line":"Harriott A.

His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape. This painting may have been part of a projected series on the four Evangelists—in addition to this work, Poussin completed a companion, <em>Landscape with Saint Matthew</em> (1640; Gemäldegalerie, Berlin).</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"100.3 × 136.4 cm (39 1/2 × 53 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":136.4,"width_in":53.625,"height_cm":100.3,"height_in":39.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"A.

Wood had seen a similar farmhouse during a visit to Eldon, Iowa.</p>\n<p>When it was exhibited at the Art Institute in 1930, the painting became an instant sensation, its ambiguity prompting viewers to speculate about the figures and their story.

Wood used his sister and dentist as models, depicting them in front of an 1880s-style house.

With its malleability and whiteness, porcelain was especially suited to the Rococo emphasis on asymmetry, natural motifs, and a palette that was lucid and light. These soft-paste porcelain surfaces, probably designed by Capodimonte’s master modeler, Giuseppe Gricci, conjure up the textures and luminescence of sea-washed shells and natural mother-of-pearl. The allusion to the marine world—so appropriate to these water-bearing vessels—is furthered by the use of shell-like forms for both the shape and decoration of the ewer and basin. The surfaces of the vessels are also encrusted with marine elements, and a trompe l’oeil coral branch cleverly serves as the ewer’s handle. Swirling lines and irregular surfaces contribute to the ewer’s sense of lightness and complete the allusion to the sea.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"H.: 30.5 cm (12 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":30.5,"height_in":12,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Soft-paste porcelain, polychrome enamels and gilding","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Norman Chatain in memory of Professor Alfred Chatain","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":6,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":20.1787,"color":{"h":37,"l":41,"s":56,"percentage":0.0009195655972118772,"population":9},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 233","gallery_id":25288,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Ceramics","artwork_type_id":36,"department_title":"Applied Arts of Europe","department_id":"PC-9","artist_id":73847,"artist_title":"Real Fabbrica della porcellana di Capodimonte","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[73847],"artist_titles":["Real Fabbrica della porcellana di Capodimonte"],"category_ids":["PC-9","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Applied Arts of Europe","Essentials"],"term_titles":["ewer (vessel)","soft-paste porcelain","gilding","Rococo","seas","porcelain","vessel","porcelain","shells","european decorative arts","ceramics","coral","enameling"],"style_id":"TM-5895","style_title":"Rococo","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-5895"],"style_titles":["Rococo"],"classification_id":"TM-11952","classification_title":"ewer (vessel)","alt_classification_ids":["TM-38","TM-27","TM-1394","TM-46"],"classification_ids":["TM-11952","TM-38","TM-27","TM-1394","TM-46"],"classification_titles":["ewer (vessel)","porcelain","vessel","european decorative arts","ceramics"],"subject_id":"TM-12286","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12162","TM-12333"],"subject_ids":["TM-12286","TM-12162","TM-12333"],"subject_titles":["seas","shells","coral"],"material_id":"TM-2447","alt_material_ids":["TM-2448"],"material_ids":["TM-2447","TM-2448"],"material_titles":["soft-paste porcelain","porcelain"],"technique_id":"TM-3887","alt_technique_ids":["TM-4001"],"technique_ids":["TM-3887","TM-4001"],"technique_titles":["gilding","enameling"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"21c98476-4704-604e-dac4-c650b5e62f9f","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Ewer","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1957.490a"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Ewer"],"weight":3434,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-20T15:55:06-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:23:50-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:38:46-06:00"}

After years of rigorous art training in Mexico City, he traveled throughout Europe from 1907 to 1910. In l9l2 Rivera settled in Paris, where he befriended other emigré avant-garde artists, such as Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. During World War l, he became a leading member of a group of Cubists that included Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Jean Metzinger.</p>\n<p>The subject of this portrait is Rivera’s lover at the time, Marevna Vorobëv-Stebelska, a Russian-born painter and writer. Photographs of the sitter, which show her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose, reveal Rivera’s gifts of observation. Seated in an overstuffed armchair, she turns away from the book she holds in her lap, as if momentarily—perhaps angrily—distracted. Vorobëv-Stebelska is stylishly dressed in a gold-brocade bodice, white sleeves, and a dress whose shape hints at a pair of crossed legs. To her right appears a green, faux-marble form that may be a fireplace, and behind her is a schematically rendered window and shutters. In this Synthetic Cubist composition, Rivera used color to suggest spatial recession, making the planes meant to be closer to the viewer brighter than those at further remove. The painting’s somber and rich color harmonies recall the palette of Gris.</p>\n<p>Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera, like many other artists in Paris, rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate for the new age. In 1921 the painter returned to Mexico, which itself had emerged from a decade of revolutionary struggle. There, adopting monumental forms that suited the country’s new political reality, he began to produce work for which he is acclaimed today: paintings, graphics, and, above all, murals depicting Mexican political and cultural life.</p>\n","short_description":"Before achieving renown as a muralist, Diego Rivera lived in Paris amid Pablo Picasso’s circle and enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter.

The artist worked on the sculpture for almost a decade and extended his exploration of the figure’s pose in numerous drawings and lithographs, at least three paintings, and another sculpture. Over time he slowly increased the size of the figure, making it one of the largest freestanding sculptures in his oeuvre.

Just six years later, Gris too was known as a Cubist and identified by at least one critic as &quot;Picasso’s disciple.&quot; Gris’s style draws upon Analytic Cubism—with its deconstruction and simultaneous viewpoint of objects—but is distinguished by a more systematic geometry and crystalline structure. Here he fractured his sitter’s head, neck, and torso into various planes and simple, geometric shapes but organized them within a regulated, compositional structure of diagonals. The artist further ordered the composition of this portrait by limiting his palette to cool blue, brown, and gray tones that, in juxtaposition, appear luminous and produce a gentle undulating rhythm across the surface of the painting.<br>Gris depicted Picasso as a painter, palette in hand. The inscription, &quot;Hommage à Pablo Picasso,&quot; at the bottom right of the painting demonstrates Gris’s respect for Picasso as a leader of the artistic circles of Paris and as an innovator of Cubism. At the same time, the inscription helped Gris solidify his own place within the Paris art world when he exhibited the portrait at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1912.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"93.3 × 74.4 cm (36 3/4 × 29 5/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":74.4,"width_in":29.3125,"height_cm":93.3,"height_in":36.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed and inscribed, l.r.: \"Hommage á Pablo Picasso/Juan Gris\"","credit_line":"Gift of Leigh B.

After seeing Whistler’s work at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in the city, Eddy traveled to the artist’s studio in Paris expressly to sit for this portrait.

Traveling to rugged sites on France’s Mediterranean coast, such as L’Estaque, depicted here, she created landscapes suffused with emotion and subjective expression. Laying down vibrant color in broad unstructured planes, she composed the scene as a collection of loosely joined organic forms. The swelling and tapering shapes along the composition’s edges produce a dynamic sense of movement that dissipates at the center, where we glimpse the calm waters of the Bay of Marseille.</p><p>Charmy was celebrated during her lifetime, but the accolades she received feel wildly gendered today. In 1921, for example, a French writer described her as an artist who “sees like a woman and paints like a man…from the one she takes grace and from the other strength, and this is what makes her such a strange and powerful painter who holds our attention.”</p>\n","short_description":"Émilie Charmy was among the first women to exhibit paintings in the Fauvist style, marked by an expressionistic and nonnaturalistic use of color.

One of many artists to depict the landmark, Delaunay did a series of Eiffel Tower paintings, of which the Art Institute’s example is among the best known. The artist infused the dynamism of modern life into this image by employing multiple viewpoints, rhythmic fragmentation of form, and strong color contrasts. Delaunay accented the structure’s towering presence by framing it with tall buildings and placing smaller, shorter buildings, seen from above, at its base. The top of the tower seems to soar, its massive structure augmented by winglike clouds and patches of light-filled sky.</p>\n<p>The artist first showed this painting in the winter of 1912, at the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris, where Guillaume Apollinaire described the work in a review as “unfinished, whether by design or accident.” Although Delaunay’s intent is not recorded, it is certain that by 1923, when this work was illustrated in the pages of the <em>Bulletin de l’effort modern</em>, it looked as it does today: the artist had repainted portions of the canvas and filled areas of reserve with paint.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"160.7 × 128.6 cm (63 1/4 × 50 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":128.6,"width_in":50.625,"height_cm":160.7,"height_in":63.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed and dated, l.r.: \"r.d. 1911\"\nInscribed on verso: \"Champs de Mars / LA Tour rouge / 1911 / r. delaunay (epoque destructive)\"","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Apollinaire, Guillaume,  Les Fenêtres (Album edited by R.

In contrast to his predecessors, Oribe preferred tea wares that were bold and eccentric rather than subtle and rustic. He was the first to recognize the beauty of artfully misshapen ceramics for use in tea gatherings. Ewers such as this were employed as water containers during the meal that preceded the tea service.

For this monumental undertaking, which he entitled <em>The Gates of Hell</em>, Rodin turned to past Italian masters. Michelangelo’s <em>Creation of Adam</em> fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508–12) inspired the pose of Rodin’s subject. Rodin rotated Michelangelo’s reclining Adam and transferred the frescoed figure’s gesture of receiving life from God to the sculpture’s right arm. The exaggerated turn of Adam’s left arm comes from Michelangelo’s sculpture of the dead Christ in his <em>Pietà</em> (1548–55; Museo del Duomo, Florence). Rodin chose the portal’s theme from Dante’s fourteenth-century epic poem <em>Inferno</em>; here Adam’s agonized body strikingly conveys the sufferings caused by original sin. Although the museum building was never constructed and the portal was not completed as originally conceived, Rodin explored the expressive potential of the human body as few artists before him had dared. As independent statues, Adam and Eve are among the commission’s numerous progeny. Not until 1938 was the gate cast in bronze and placed at the entrance to the grounds of the Musée Rodin, Paris.</p>\n","short_description":"Auguste Rodin's figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve to flank his monumental bronze portal, The Gates of Hell, for the Musée de Arts Décoratifs, Paris.

The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"60.3 × 80.4 cm (23 3/4 × 31 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80.4,"width_in":31.625,"height_cm":60.3,"height_in":23.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower left: Berthe Morisot","credit_line":"Stickney Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"W.

Taken during the preceding two years, while he traveled throughout the South for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) under the direction of Roy Stryker, these images document the plight of the rural poor during the Depression. With clinical precision and a fastidious reserve, Evans photographed main streets, storefronts, hand-painted signs, gas stations, abandoned buildings, and automobiles. He took pictures of tenant farmers’ homes—their kitchens, beds, bureau drawers, and fireplaces—with and without their occupants. Taken for Fortune magazine while Evans, on leave from the FSA, was traveling with the writer James Agee, this famous photograph shows a tenant farmer’s wife standing outside her house. With patient dignity, she looks straight at the viewer, a shy half-smile on her lips. This work is part of a remarkable collaboration with Agee published in the book <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> (1941). As one of the nation’s finest documentary photographers, Evans continued this exacting and lucid description of American culture throughout his career.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 21 × 17 cm (8 5/16 × 6 3/4 in.); Mount: 45.7 × 35.6 cm (18 × 14 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":17,"width_in":6.693,"height_cm":21,"height_in":8.2678,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":35.6,"width_in":14.0158,"height_cm":45.7,"height_in":17.9922,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Mount"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":"No markings recto or verso","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mrs. James Ward Thorne","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Wood, James N. and Teri J.

As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"100 × 110.7 cm (39 3/8 × 43 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":110.7,"width_in":43.5625,"height_cm":100,"height_in":39.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Daniel Catton Rich, “Bequest of Mrs. L.

His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.</p>\n<p>Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"99.8 × 119.9 cm (39 1/4 × 47 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":119.9,"width_in":47.1875,"height_cm":99.8,"height_in":39.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Elio Forzi, “Comment M.

Many Impressionist paintings depict the Café Nouvelle-Athènes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for Édouard Manet and his circle—a group that included the painters Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and the writers Charles Baudelaire and Émile Zola.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite café: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet's paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio.</p>\n<p><em>Woman Reading</em> is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.</p>\n","short_description":"Édouard Manet was a pivotal figure in the development of Impressionism and modern art. Here, an elegantly dressed Parisian woman reads a magazine, a beer close at hand—a scene that would have struck contemporary viewers as fashionable and modern. While the woman appears to be outdoors, one of Manet’s paintings serves as a backdrop and other props suggest the scene was staged in Manet’s studio.","dimensions":"61.2 × 50.7 cm (24 1/16 × 19 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":50.7,"width_in":19.875,"height_cm":61.2,"height_in":24.0625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower left: Manet","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Théodore Duret, Histoire d’Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1902), no. 255.\n\nThéodore Duret, Manet and the French Impressionists (London, 1910), p. 251, no. 255.\n\nLéon Leenhoff, Manet: Ensemble de notes et de documents sur le peintre, c. 1910.

This may explain why <em>Two Sisters (On the Terrace)</em> is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.</p>\n","short_description":"Despite the title, the young women in this painting were not actually sisters.

The pomp and color of this great city were expressed most distinctively through its monumental architecture. Facades of pyramids and interiors of palaces, temples, and homes were frequently decorated with splendid frescoes. The fragment shown here was part of a cycle painted on the interior walls of an aristocratic palace. It shows a rain priest walking or dancing in profile and wearing an elaborate headdress and costume. His speech-scroll, adorned with seashells and plants, indicates that he is praying for water and agricultural prosperity, which were highly valued in his society.</p>\n<p>Meaning “place of the gods,” Teotihuacan was the largest religious, military, and trading city in the Americas between A.D. 200 and 650, and it was inhabited by over one hundred thousand people at its peak. Designed with colossal pyramids and ritual plazas, the metropolis was built on a cosmologically oriented grid plan that embraced residential and manufacturing districts. This richly symbolic fragment from a Teotihuacan wall fresco depicts a ceremony that took place once every fifty-two years, a “century” in the ancient Mexican calendar system. A priest stands before a tied bundle of reeds representing the completion of a cycle of time. The bundle is impaled by the spiny points of maguey cactus leaves, with which the priestly protagonist of the scene has pricked himself to provide a blood offering. Water symbols in the form of shells and flowers are depicted within the speech-scroll curling from the priest’s mouth. Additional flowers and water are sprinkled from one of the priest’s hands, while in the other he holds an incense bag. Corresponding to the chants of a religious litany, this complex image was repeated with others on the walls of a chamber as a prayer of thanksgiving and for the renewal of agricultural fertility.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"63.8 × 95 cm (25 × 37 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":95,"width_in":37.5,"height_cm":63.8,"height_in":25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Lime plaster with mineral pigment","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"African and Amerindian Art Purchase Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":21,"fiscal_year":1963,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":39.9031,"color":{"h":7,"l":40,"s":40,"percentage":0.15077624804789694,"population":755},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 136","gallery_id":2147475440,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Architectural fragment","artwork_type_id":19,"department_title":"Arts of the Americas","department_id":"PC-3","artist_id":44159,"artist_title":"Teotihuacan","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[44159],"artist_titles":["Teotihuacan"],"category_ids":["PC-3","PC-829","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Arts of the Americas","Latin American","Essentials"],"term_titles":["inorganic pigment","burnishing (polishing)","teotihuacán","painting","ritual","fresco painting","pigment","colorant","polishing","finishing (process)","fresco painting","painting techniques","mesoamerican","Pre-Columbian","americas","priests","Hieroglyphs","red (color)","Mexico","mythology","religion","murals","landscapes","agriculture","praying","plaster","architectural fragment","art of the americas","Arts of the Americas"],"style_id":"TM-6642","style_title":"teotihuacán","alt_style_ids":["TM-6522","TM-6516","TM-6515","TM-13488"],"style_ids":["TM-6642","TM-6522","TM-6516","TM-6515","TM-13488"],"style_titles":["teotihuacán","mesoamerican","Pre-Columbian","americas","Arts of the Americas"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-1203","TM-184","TM-13487"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-1203","TM-184","TM-13487"],"classification_titles":["painting","fresco painting","architectural fragment","art of the americas"],"subject_id":"TM-12859","alt_subject_ids":["TM-8785","TM-12185","TM-11851","TM-12299","TM-8766","TM-11421","TM-12300","TM-8657","TM-12156","TM-12734"],"subject_ids":["TM-12859","TM-8785","TM-12185","TM-11851","TM-12299","TM-8766","TM-11421","TM-12300","TM-8657","TM-12156","TM-12734"],"subject_titles":["ritual","priests","Hieroglyphs","red (color)","Mexico","mythology","religion","murals","landscapes","agriculture","praying"],"material_id":"TM-3426","alt_material_ids":["TM-2509","TM-3239","TM-2439"],"material_ids":["TM-3426","TM-2509","TM-3239","TM-2439"],"material_titles":["inorganic pigment","pigment","colorant","plaster"],"technique_id":"TM-3918","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3913","TM-4282","TM-4259","TM-3971"],"technique_ids":["TM-3918","TM-3913","TM-4282","TM-4259","TM-3971"],"technique_titles":["burnishing (polishing)","polishing","finishing (process)","fresco painting","painting techniques"],"theme_titles":["Latin American","Essentials"],"image_id":"09d2b000-8e44-c735-5099-126d6453aaaa","alt_image_ids":["08b944f6-4558-d0fd-730f-d29905f4d143"],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Mural Fragment Depicting a Maguey Bloodletting Ritual","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1962.702"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Mural Fragment Depicting a Maguey Bloodletting Ritual"],"weight":6293,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-14T14:05:40-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:05:53-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:39:14-06:00"}

Depicted here is the most frequently represented episode from the popular legend of Saint George, in which the model Christian knight saves a town and rescues a beautiful princess. Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George’s halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration. Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture.</p>\n","short_description":"Bernat Martorell was one of the greatest painters in Catalonia, Spain, during the first half of the 15th century.

He had studied at China’s most progressive art academy, training in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting and calligraphy. Despite his education, Zao’s arrival in the cosmopolitan French capital prompted for him a more tangible, as well as conceptual, reckoning with Eastern and Western aesthetics. However, it was not until he traveled to the United States, where he viewed Abstract Expressionist paintings for the first time, did the artist embrace exclusively the atmospheric abstraction for which he became known. After returning to Paris, Zao began to create sweeping, large-scale compositions and swiftly rose to prominence among a circle of fellow Paris-based abstract painters interested in lyrical and intuitive mark making, including American Joan Mitchell and German-born Hans Hartung.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Night is Stirring</em>, Zao built up layers of jewel-toned color, activated by touches of lurid red and a torquing column that seems to climb up the center of the canvas. While his dark, inky brushstrokes call to mind Chinese calligraphy, still more traditional Chinese painting is reflected through Zao’s manipulation of the tropes of the landscape format, which emphasizes the rhythms<br>and energies of nature more than a strictly realistic approach. Suspended between the conventions of Chinese landscape painting and the materiality of Western oil painting, Zao’s canvas occupies other in-between states as well; it is, for example, an abstract work that suggests not only landscape in general but nightfall more specifically. Zhang borrowed the title from a book of poems by writer and painter Henri Michaux, a close friend and mentor.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Without frame: 193 × 130 cm (76 × 51 3/16 in.); 194.4 × 129.6 cm (76 1/2 × 51 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":130,"width_in":51.1812,"height_cm":193,"height_in":75.9843,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Without frame"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":129.6,"width_in":51,"height_cm":194.4,"height_in":76.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on linen","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Kootz","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":40.6731,"color":{"h":356,"l":52,"s":56,"percentage":0.0007472375561595726,"population":8},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":37410,"artist_title":"Wou-Ki Zao","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[37410],"artist_titles":["Wou-Ki Zao"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting","oil painting","oil paint (paint)","contemporary","night","modern and contemporary art","painting (image making)","linen (material)","red (color)","blue (color)"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-13355","alt_subject_ids":["TM-11851","TM-11843"],"subject_ids":["TM-13355","TM-11851","TM-11843"],"subject_titles":["night","red (color)","blue (color)"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3093"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3093"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","linen (material)"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"0f07eb70-3818-676a-c047-b1672d0a8277","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"The Night is Stirring (La nuit remue)","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1962.904"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Night is Stirring (La nuit remue)"],"weight":3553,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-15T16:54:37-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:00:18-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:39:18-06:00"}

They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>\n<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel).

The medallion above the crucified Christ contains an image of Christ in Glory, holding a palm in each hand to symbolize his victory over death. Below, the crowned figure of King David holds an inscribed scroll. More often in Crucifixion scenes of this period, a pelican appears at the top of the cross and the skull of Adam lies at the foot. A penitential theme is suggested by the figures kneeling under the Cross: on the right is a haloed Magdalen in a red robe; on the left, a man with the incised rays of a <em>beatus</em>, or blessed one, emanating from his head wears the torn brown cloak of a hermit. He was probably meant to represent a specific hermit within the Camaldolese order. The panel has a hole drilled at the base, allowing it to be mounted on a pole and used as a processional cross, likely in the monastic Camaldolese community of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Lorenzo lived and worked.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Tempera on panel","inscriptions":"Inscription: atop the cross, ICXC (Jesus Christ); on the scroll held by the figure at the foot of the cross, [MISE] RERE MEI D[EUS] (Have mercy upon me, O God)","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

The sitter—identifiable through his coat of arms, personal motto, and initials on the back of the panel—is Jean Gros, an administrator to the future duke of Burgundy. His prayerful gaze was originally directed at another panel with an image of Mary and the infant Jesus, now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Tournai, Belgium. Gros’s coat of arms is on the back of that panel as well.</p>\n<p>This type of diptych, which was intended to suggest continuous prayer and to record the donor’s features, was probably first made for princes around 1400. Rogier van der Weyden revitalized the portrait tradition in the mid-15th century, creating similar diptychs for patrons at the highest level of the Burgundian court. In commissioning one for himself, Gros was displaying his ambition and his close associations with the court.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"38.5 × 28.8 cm (15 3/16 × 11 3/8 in.); Painted surface: 36.5 × 27 cm (14 3/8 × 10 5/8 in.); Reverse: 39 × 28.8 cm (15 3/8 × 11 3/8 in.); Reverse painted surface: 36.8 × 26.7 cm (14 1/2 × 10 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":28.8,"width_in":11.375,"height_cm":38.5,"height_in":15.1875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":27,"width_in":10.625,"height_cm":36.5,"height_in":14.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Painted surface"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":28.8,"width_in":11.375,"height_cm":39,"height_in":15.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Reverse"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":26.7,"width_in":10.5,"height_cm":36.8,"height_in":14.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Reverse painted surface"}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":"Inscribed: Reverse: coat of arms of Jean Gros,1 GRACES .

Although <em>The Annunciation</em> appears to be an independent painting, it is actually a fragment that once formed the right side of an altarpiece; the left side, now in the National Gallery, London, depicts the moment of Mary’s own Immaculate Conception, believed to have occurred when her parents, Joachim and Anne, greeted each other at the Golden Gate. A central section, now lost, probably featured the enthroned Virgin and Child, perhaps with Saint Anne. Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins,was the leading painter working in France in the last decades of the fifteenth century. He worked in Moulins in central France for Duke Pierre II of Bourbon and his wife, Anne of France, who played a large role in the government of of the kingdom during the minority of Anne’s brother Charles VIII. As their court painter, Hey, who was probably of Netherlandish origin, fused the intense naturalism and preciousness of Flemish and French painting and manuscript illumination with the emerging Renais-sance interest in antiquity, as is evident in this painting’s Italianate architecture.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"72.5 × 50.1 cm (28 1/2 × 19 11/16 in.); Painted surface: 71.7 × 49.2 cm (28 1/4 × 19 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":50.1,"width_in":19.6875,"height_cm":72.5,"height_in":28.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":49.2,"width_in":19.375,"height_cm":71.7,"height_in":28.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Painted surface"}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"The Art Institute of Chicago, Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional. Not locked tightly in place, his forms appear to touch and shift continually, creating a sense of volume and space that strengthens the composition and brings it to life.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"80.2 × 100.6 cm (31 5/8 × 39 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":100.6,"width_in":39.625,"height_cm":80.2,"height_in":31.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

Tiepolo enjoyed an international career and was called upon to use his mastery of light, color, and illusion to transform palaces and monasteries in his native Venice and elsewhere in Italy, as well as in Germany and Spain. This painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=GIAMBATTISTA%20TIEPOLO&department_ids=Painting%20and%20Sculpture%20of%20Europe&date-start=1740CE&date-end=1745CE\">and three others</a> at the Art Institute, together with smaller decorative panels and a ceiling painting, once graced the cabinet of mirrors, a richly decorated room in the Venetian palace of the powerful Cornaro family. The suite illustrates Torquato Tasso’s popular sixteenth-century epic romance <em>Jerusalem Delivered</em>, which is set in the eleventh century, during the First Crusade, when Western knights sought to take Jerusalem from the Muslims. The canvas captures the moment of Rinaldo’s seduction: the beautiful sorceress Armida has just arrived to divert the sleeping hero from his crusade. Accompanied by her attendant nymph and a cupid figure, she appears like a beautiful mirage, enthroned on a billowing cloud, her drapery and shawl wafting gently behind her. Altough Tasso’s story symbolizes the conﬂict between love and duty, Tiepolo’s depiction of a magical, bucolic world—enhanced by effervescent colors, luminous atmosphere, and dense, creamy paint—seems to evoke only love’s enchantment.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"187.5 × 216.8 cm (73 13/16 × 85 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":216.8,"width_in":85.375,"height_cm":187.5,"height_in":73.8125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Bequest of James Deering","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Pompeo Molmenti, G.

The Roman soldiers force him to don a crown of thorns and proffer a reed “scepter” and purple cloak, all intended to ridicule him as “King of the Jews,” a title bestowed ironically by his tormenters. Manet, who painted very few religious subjects, transformed this sacred narrative into a gritty drama that marries realism with theatricality. Shown without a halo, Jesus glows against the dark background. Is he a holy being emanating divine light or a real man posing under a studio spotlight? The painting caused a scandal in its own time for precisely this ambiguity.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"190.8 × 148.3 cm (74 7/8 × 58 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":148.3,"width_in":58.375,"height_cm":190.8,"height_in":74.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower right: Manet","credit_line":"Gift of James Deering","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Emile Zola, Preface in Manet Exposition Particulière, exh. cat.

Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for <em>Beata Beatrix</em> in his namesake’s <em>La vita nuova (The New Life</em>; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state.</p>\n<p>Rossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from <em>La Vita Nuova</em>. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death. Rossetti designed the frame, and at the top right he inscribed, “How doth the city sit solitary.” This quote from <em>La Vita Nuova</em> refers to the city of Florence’s mourning of Beatrice.</p>\n<p>Given the deeply personal nature of the work, Rossetti initially refused his patron William Graham’s request to create a replica, although he eventually yielded. The Art Institute’s painting is this second version, which is the only one to have a predella—the painted scene at the bottom of the frame—depicting Beatrice and Dante’s reunion in paradise. With this addition, Rossetti provides the medieval love story with a happy conclusion, perhaps suggesting that he, too, had begun to come to terms with his own profound grief.</p>\n","short_description":"Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a circle of Victorian artists united in their regard for medieval aesthetics.

These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\">water-lily series</a> (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted <em>Water Lilies</em>, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"89.9 × 94.1 cm (35 3/8 × 37 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":94.1,"width_in":37.0625,"height_cm":89.9,"height_in":35.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower right: Claude Monet 1906","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

Their paintings abound with scenes of grand boulevards and elegant, new blocks of buildings, as well as achievements of modern construction such as iron bridges, exhibition halls, and train sheds. <em>Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare</em> was an especially appropriate choice of subject for Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably placing them in the same gallery.</p>\n<p>Monet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure, and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a specific motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes. But the series also represented his last attempt to deal with urban realities: from this point on in his career, Monet would be largely a painter of landscapes.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"60.3 × 80.2 cm (23 3/4 × 31 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80.2,"width_in":31.5,"height_cm":60.3,"height_in":23.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed, lower left: Claude Monet 77","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

As a watercolorist, Homer adapted his practice to the diverse locales he visited. His sojourns in the tropics took him to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cuba, and various locations in Florida. In each new environment, the self-taught artist pushed the flexible medium in new directions as he applied his increasingly sophisticated understanding of color and light to a new set of atmospheric conditions. This compelling watercolor was painted during Homer’s second trip to the Bahamas in the winter of 1898–99. Depicting a luckless man washed up on the beach, surrounded by fragments of his shattered craft, the work demonstrates the artist’s fascination with the rapid and dangerous weather changes of the region. Here sunlight glints through gradually thinning storm clouds. Homer employed thickly applied opaque red and yellow pigments for the seaweed tossed on the sand, creating a contrast with the thin washes and fluid brushstrokes that he used to render the receding waves.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"37.2 × 54.2 cm (14 11/16 × 21 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":54.2,"width_in":21.3386,"height_cm":37.2,"height_in":14.6457,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Transparent watercolor, with touches of opaque watercolor, rewetting, blotting and scraping, over graphite, on moderately thick, moderately textured (twill texture on verso), ivory wove paper","inscriptions":"Signed recto, lower left corner, in brush and black watercolor: \"Homer 99\"\nInscribed verso, upper center, in graphite: \"25 814\"; upper center, in black chalk, crossed out in graphite: \"10\"; center, in graphite: \"MK C.20782//oxx//After the Tornado//3 M.<. 1027-\"; lower left corner, in graphite: \"After the Tornado\"","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

Profoundly interested in avant-garde European art, he experimented with a variety of styles. Young artists working in New York were particularly stimulated by the European Surrealists, many of whom moved to the city before and during World War II and whose circle Gorky joined. The 1940s, especially the years 1944–47, marked the creation of his most important work, produced in a kind of stream of consciousness or “automatic” manner of painting. <em>The Plough and the Song</em> reflects the artist’s indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Miró, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are hallmarks of Gorky’s mature work. A delicate contour line delineates the biomorphic forms in the center of the composition, in marked contrast to the loose brushwork that defines the background. The title signals Gorky’s nostalgia for his heritage, as the artist wrote in 1944: “You cannot imagine the fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows. . . . And the songs, our ancient songs of the Armenian people, our suffering people. . . . So many shapes, so many shapes and ideas, happily a secret treasure to which I have been entrusted the key.” Deeply earthbound and poetic, <em>The Plough and the Song</em> is at once a still life, a landscape, and a fantasy.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"134.2 × 155.7 cm (51 7/8 × 61 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":155.7,"width_in":61.375,"height_cm":134.2,"height_in":51.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"No inscriptions.","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis L.

This large, haunting etching, <em>The Frugal Meal</em>, was one of the last works of his Blue Period (1901–4), a time when the struggling artist’s palette was dominated by the color blue, then symbolically associated with melancholy—the mood in which he portrayed his array of poor, ill, and outcast characters. Completed just after Picasso settled permanently in France, moving into a dilapidated Montmartre tenement nicknamed the Bateau-Lavoir, or “Washerwoman’s Boat,” this austere etching brings together two subjects that fascinated him—couples in cafés and the experience of the blind—with a high degree of refinement. The man’s emaciated face is in profile, while the woman stares directly at the viewer, emphasizing her companion’s blindness. The angular bodies and elongated fingers of the two figures reflect the scarcity of both their meal and their means. <em>The Frugal Meal</em>, which was only Picasso’s second attempt at printmaking, reveals the artist’s extraordinary gift for draftsmanship and his remarkable facility with new media and techniques.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Plate: 48 × 38 cm (18 15/16 × 15 in.); Sheet: 57.5 × 43.8 cm (22 11/16 × 17 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":38,"width_in":14.9607,"height_cm":48,"height_in":18.8977,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Plate"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":43.8,"width_in":17.2441,"height_cm":57.5,"height_in":22.6378,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Etching on zinc in blue-green on ivory laid paper (discolored to cream)","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>Geiser 2 II/II, a</p><p>Bloch 1</p><p>Baer & Geiser 2 II/II, a.1</p>","publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":3,"fiscal_year":1964,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 Estate of Pablo Picasso / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":0,"color":{"h":148,"l":51,"s":5,"percentage":0.0005559099025021615,"population":457},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 125","gallery_id":25084,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Print","artwork_type_id":18,"department_title":"Prints and Drawings","department_id":"PC-13","artist_id":36198,"artist_title":"Pablo Picasso","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[36198],"artist_titles":["Pablo Picasso"],"category_ids":["PC-13","PC-832","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Prints and Drawings","Drinking and Dining","Essentials"],"term_titles":["etching","etching","food","paper (fiber product)","Cubism","ink","print","prints and drawing","poverty","drinking","dinners","couples","paper","laid paper"],"style_id":"TM-7539","style_title":"Cubism","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-7539"],"style_titles":["Cubism"],"classification_id":"TM-18","classification_title":"etching","alt_classification_ids":["TM-17","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_ids":["TM-18","TM-17","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_titles":["etching","print","prints and drawing","paper"],"subject_id":"TM-8673","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12344","TM-12077","TM-12343","TM-9130"],"subject_ids":["TM-8673","TM-12344","TM-12077","TM-12343","TM-9130"],"subject_titles":["food","poverty","drinking","dinners","couples"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":["TM-2398","TM-3070"],"material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-2398","TM-3070"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)","ink","laid paper"],"technique_id":"TM-3874","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3874"],"technique_titles":["etching"],"theme_titles":["Drinking and Dining","Essentials"],"image_id":"bf1f0174-0711-c3f8-f188-8192022c3257","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"The Frugal Meal, from The Saltimbanques","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1963.825"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Frugal Meal, from The Saltimbanques"],"weight":4317,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-19T13:52:37-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:29:24-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:39:37-06:00"}

Turquoise—for the peoples of ancient Peru, a precious gem related to the worship of water and sky—is inlaid around the headdress cap and in the ear ornaments. The tumi was made with diverse metalworking techniques. Solid casting was used to produce the blade. The face and body were created with annealing (heating, shaping, and then cooling) and repoussé, in which the relief design is hammered into a mold from the reverse side. Finally, the small ornaments around the top of the headdress were separately hammered or cast, then soldered into place.

Here four women wrapped in shawls slowly stroll through the garden. The two closest to the viewer avert their gazes and curiously cover their mouths. Their somber outlines echo the two orange cones, which probably represent shrubs wrapped against the frost. The bench along the upper-left path rises steeply, defying logical perspective. Equally puzzling is the mysterious bush on the left, in which Gauguin consciously embedded forms that suggest eyes and a nose, creating the impression of a strange, watchful presence. With its aura of repressed emotion and elusive meaning, <em>Arlésiennes (Mistral)</em> explores the ambiguities, mysteries, and emotions that Gauguin believed underlie appearances.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"73 × 92 cm (28 3/4 × 36 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92,"width_in":36.1875,"height_cm":73,"height_in":28.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on jute canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower left: P Gauguin.

This elderly vagabond from the Savoy region of France was one of many peasants who, around the turn of the eighteenth century, flocked to Paris, where they tried to eke out livings as chimney sweeps, scavengers, or street entertainers. This old entertainer’s props accompany him: a large box of curiosities is on his back, and under his arm is a smaller case probably containing his constant companion and coperformer, a furry marmot. Using only two colors of chalk, Watteau depicted the Savoyard’s shrewd, humorous face, his tattered clothing, and his bulky paraphernalia with remarkable precision, sensitivity, and humanity. Of the ten extant studies of Savoyards by Watteau, four appear to portray the same salty character seen here. The drawing’s broad, free execution points to the accomplished late works of this gifted artist.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"35.9 × 22.1 cm (14 3/16 × 8 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":22.1,"width_in":8.7008,"height_cm":35.9,"height_in":14.1339,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Red and black chalk on cream laid paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Helen Regenstein Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Edmond de Goncourt, Catalogue Raisonné de l’Oeuvre Peint, Dessiné et Grave d’Antoine Watteau (Paris, 1875), p. 243, no. 370.\n\nK.

Rooted in the Romantic tradition, Moreau focused on the expression of timeless enigmas of human existence rather than on recording or capturing the realities of the material world.</p>\n<p>Long fascinated with the myth of Hercules, Moreau gave his fertile imagination free rein in <em>Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra</em>. Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra’s seventh, “immortal” head, which he will later bury.</p>\n<p>Despite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau’s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting.</p>\n<p>Moreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns. He was profoundly affected by France’s humiliating military defeat by Prussia in 1870–71. Whether or not Hercules literally personifies France and the Hydra represents Prussia, this monumental work portrays a moral battle between the forces of good and evil, and of light and darkness, with intensity and power.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"179.3 × 154 cm (70 9/16 × 60 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":154,"width_in":60.625,"height_cm":179.3,"height_in":70.5625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower left: Gustave Moreau","credit_line":"Gift of Mrs. Eugene A.

Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>, painted less than a decade later.</p>\n","short_description":"Considered Caillebotte’s masterpiece, this view of a busy intersection captures both an everyday moment and all that was new in a rapidly changing Paris. The clothes are the latest fashion. The retractable umbrella was just invented. And a decades-long renovation had transformed the medieval streets of Paris into grand boulevards, like the ones seen here. It's a painting you want to walk into.","dimensions":"212.2 × 276.2 cm (83 1/2 × 108 3/4 in.); Framed: 241.3 × 306.1 × 10.2 cm (95 × 120 1/2 × 4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":276.2,"width_in":108.75,"height_cm":212.2,"height_in":83.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":10.2,"depth_in":4,"width_cm":306.1,"width_in":120.5,"height_cm":241.3,"height_in":95,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Framed"}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower left: G.

As in other images from Nagapattinam, a flame emerges out of the Buddha’s cranial protuberance, probably signifying wisdom.

One  of his earliest animal drawings, <em>Young Steer</em> shows its subject grazing in an unseen field. The artist’s sure strokes and adept cross-hatching delineate the steer’s sculptural form, with taut skin stretched over a strong yet bony frame. Dürer’s precise draftsmanship recalls the drawings and prints of the celebrated German master Martin Schongauer, whom he greatly admired. This work was probably a study from nature; sketchy lines around the animal’s right hind foot, back, muzzle, and horns reveal that the artist originally drew the steer in a slightly different position, with his mouth open. A masterful engraver who would elevate printmaking to an expressive art form over the course of his career, Dürer employed the steer’s hindquarters for the barnyard scene in his engraving <em>The Prodigal Son amid the Swine</em> (1494/96), an impression of which is in the Art Institute.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"17.5 × 14 cm (6 15/16 × 5 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":14,"width_in":5.5119,"height_cm":17.5,"height_in":6.8898,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Pen and black ink on ivory laid paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":3,"fiscal_year":1965,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":10.0452,"color":{"h":39,"l":49,"s":9,"percentage":0.009036926712812188,"population":79},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Drawing and Watercolor","artwork_type_id":14,"department_title":"Prints and Drawings","department_id":"PC-13","artist_id":40561,"artist_title":"Albrecht Dürer","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[40561],"artist_titles":["Albrecht Dürer"],"category_ids":["PC-13","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Prints and Drawings","Essentials"],"term_titles":["pen and ink drawings","ink","drawing (image-making)","bulls","animals","drawings (visual works)","prints and drawing","paper (fiber product)","laid paper","paper"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-212","classification_title":"pen and ink drawings","alt_classification_ids":["TM-5","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_ids":["TM-212","TM-5","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_titles":["pen and ink drawings","drawings (visual works)","prints and drawing","paper"],"subject_id":"TM-11331","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12218"],"subject_ids":["TM-11331","TM-12218"],"subject_titles":["bulls","animals"],"material_id":"TM-2398","alt_material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-3070"],"material_ids":["TM-2398","TM-2982","TM-3070"],"material_titles":["ink","paper (fiber product)","laid paper"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3919"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"d2529576-bbf0-c631-6f8c-659e825c552d","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Young Bull","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1965.408"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Young Bull"],"weight":3309,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:18:49-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:27:14-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:39:47-06:00"}

These words aptly describe this heroic portrait of the artist’s mother, Shushan der Marderosian. Although of noble lineage, Shushan and her family were peasants who faced poverty and Turkish persecution and massacre; in 1919 she died from starvation. The following year, Gorky and one of his sisters immigrated to the United States. This tender, haunting image is based on a photograph of the artist with his mother taken in 1912. Clad in simple country clothes, Shushan is a gaunt, distant figure with remarkable and piercing eyes. Gorky depicted his mother with careful, classical simplicity, transforming her dark beauty into the perfect features of an Orthodox church icon. The same photograph served as the inspiration for two canvases entitled <em>The Artist and His Mother</em> (1926–c. 1936; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; c. 1926–c. 1942; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), as well as numerous notebook sketches and other drawings, of which this is the most finished. From this early representational mode, Gorky’s art underwent a complex evolution that led, in the 1940s, to his dynamic, biomorphic abstractions. Tragically, the artist did not escape hardship. After a series of personal disasters in the 1940s, Gorky took his own life.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"63 × 48.5 cm (24 13/16 × 19 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":48.5,"width_in":19.0945,"height_cm":63,"height_in":24.8032,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Charcoal on ivory laid paper","inscriptions":"Signed recto, lower right, in charcoal: \"A Gorky / 1926 [or 1936]\"","credit_line":"Worcester Sketch Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Ethel K.

While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.</p>\n<p>In his 1931 autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.</p>\n<p>Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s <em>Praying Jew</em> is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of <em>The Praying Jew</em> before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"116.8 × 89.4 cm (46 × 35 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":89.4,"width_in":35.1875,"height_cm":116.8,"height_in":46,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"MArc / ChAgAll\"","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Bulletin de l’Effort Moderne 2 (February 1924), n.p.

Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture. The expressive, idyllic quality of this painting presages the radiant ceiling frescoes of Correggio’s maturity, especially those in Parma’s Cathedral.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"64.2 × 50.2 cm (25 1/4 × 19 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":50.2,"width_in":19.75,"height_cm":64.2,"height_in":25.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clyde M.

One pair of his arms balances the flame of destruction and the hand drum (<em>damaru</em>) that beats the rhythm of life while another performs symbolic gestures: the raised right hand means “fear not,” and the left hand (<em>gajahasta</em>) pointing down toward his raised left foot signifies release from the ignorance that hinders realization of the ultimate reality. Shiva is shown perfectly balanced, with his right leg planted on the demon of darkness (<em>Apasmara</em>), stamping out ignorance. The tiny figure of the personified river goddess, Ganga, is caught up in his matted, flowing locks. Shiva was believed to break the fall of the great Ganges River as it descends from the Himalayas by standing beneath the waters, which divide over his hair, becoming the seven holy rivers of India. This classic bronze comes from the Chola period in the south of India.

His brightly painted canvases depicting everyday objects, as well as scenes of war and romance culled from the pages of contemporary comics, were rendered in stylized black outlines and hand-painted Ben Day dots that mimicked the commercial printing process. Thus he seemed to elevate what was often seen as low art—both its quotidian, affective subject matter and its visual terms—into high art. This was never simply a straightforward process of reversal, however, and by mid-decade Lichtenstein began to focus on subjects that reflected his lifelong interest in art historical themes.</p>\n<p><em>Brushstroke with Spatter</em>, from the <em>Brushstroke</em> series (1965–67), is a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. This deadpan rendering is not purely comic, but also establishes a tension key to the work’s success as an abstract painting in its own right, with grand scalar play and dramatic cropping, intensity of color, and the optical pulse of the dotted ground.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"172.7 × 203.2 cm (68 × 80 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":203.2,"width_in":80,"height_cm":172.7,"height_in":68,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil and magna on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Barbara Neff Smith and Solomon Byron Smith Purchase Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Estate of Roy Lichtenstein","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":0,"color":{"h":56,"l":45,"s":95,"percentage":0.0007646238491693037,"population":599},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":35480,"artist_title":"Roy Lichtenstein","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[35480],"artist_titles":["Roy Lichtenstein"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting","Pop Art","abstract shapes","oil painting","oil paint (paint)","modern and contemporary art","painting (image making)","magna","yellow (color)","blue (color)","painting","canvas"],"style_id":"TM-7221","style_title":"Pop Art","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-7221"],"style_titles":["Pop Art"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-12708","alt_subject_ids":["TM-11842","TM-11843","TM-12737"],"subject_ids":["TM-12708","TM-11842","TM-11843","TM-12737"],"subject_titles":["abstract shapes","yellow (color)","blue (color)","painting"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-12055","TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-12055","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","magna","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"f8dbda50-a10b-d0ff-a35c-24c2f9e733f1","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Brushstroke with Spatter","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1966.3"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Brushstroke with Spatter"],"weight":13360,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-12T11:32:40-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:28:37-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:39:56-06:00"}

The narrative continues in the top register with the Road to Calvary, Christ on the Cross, and the encounter of Christ and Mary Madgalen after the Resurrection. Such small devotional objects might be kept on a stand or cabinet in a bedroom, ready to be used as a focus for prayer by the layperson who owned them, along with an illuminated Psalter or Book of Hours. The intimate scale and movable wings of the triptych made it easy to store in a chest or to carry from one residence to another as needed. Although Paris has long been recognized as a great center for ivory carving in the Gothic era, recent scholarship has also emphasized the importance of workshops in England, Germany, and Italy—affirming the popularity of the medium throughout medieval Europe.

Cisterns such as this were filled with cold water and used to cool wine bottles at feasts. Skillfully decorated by the Italian ceramic painter Francesco Durantino, this work typifies the Renaissance interest in both Christian imagery and scenes from pagan antiquity. It is covered with depictions of two famous battle scenes, one on land and one at sea. Although the exterior, adapted from frescoes by Raphael’s followers, represents a land battle culminating in the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine I to Christianity, the cistern’s interior depicts a legendary naval disaster: the sinking of the Trojan hero Aeneas’s ships by the jealous goddess Hera. At the cistern’s center, the ships disappear beneath the waves, a playful conceit that was no doubt even more effective when the cistern was filled with water. The generously sized vessel displays all the characteristics that made maiolica, a tin-glazed earthenware, popular: brilliant colors, lively painting, and riveting narratives mixed with fanciful design. The term <em>maiolica</em> probably comes from Majorca, the port through which pottery from Moorish Spain was first exported to Italy.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"53.3 × 26.7 cm (21 × 10 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":26.7,"width_in":10.5,"height_cm":53.3,"height_in":21,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica)","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mary Waller Langhorne Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Albert Jacquemart, History of the Ceramic Art (London, 1877), p. 294.\n\nC.

They also probably account for the portrait’s unfinished state. David, a renowned Neoclassical painter, was at the time an ardent revolutionary; Madame de Pastoret was the wife of a staunch royalist. The sittings must have occurred after the birth, early in 1791, of her son, who is portrayed asleep by her side, and before her brief imprisonment during the Reign of Terror in 1792. Here David completed the stippled, almost monochromatic underpainting but did not create the stark, enamel-smooth surface that is characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even get far enough to place a needle and thread in Madame de Pastoret’s hand. Nevertheless, this large portrait of unaffected domesticity captures the youthful mother with charm as well as dignity and displays David’s skill as a portraitist. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret (who became the Marquise de Pastoret in 1817) refused the painting during the artist’s lifetime. After David’s death, she had her son, by then an adult, purchase the portrait from the artist’s estate.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"129.8 × 96.6 cm (51 1/8 × 38 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":96.6,"width_in":38,"height_cm":129.8,"height_in":51.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clyde M.

Three years later, he helped pioneer a general migration of artists to the neighborhood of Montparnasse, which remained the center of avant-gard activity in the city until World War II. Scores of artists lived there, and many of them shared a Jewish heritage—including Modigliani and his friend the Lithuanian-born sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.</p>\n<p>Lipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian poet Berthe Kitrosser, as a way of helping his troubled friend financially. The double portrait is one of only three in the artist’s oeuvre and, according to Lipchitz, took two days to paint. Modigliani made about twenty drawings on the first day; the next day, he declared the picture finished. At the modest price of what Lipchitz remembered as “ten francs per sitting and a little alcohol,” however, he persuaded Modigliani to work on the portrait for another two weeks in an effort to provide more financial assistance to his friend. Despite Modigliani’s exceptional talent, his work found a market only after his death in 1920, which was hastened by tuberculosis and his legendary bohemian lifestyle.</p>\n","short_description":"Amedeo Modigliani created his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Focusing on a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.

Although he took his subject from modern life, Seurat sought to evoke the sense of timelessness associated with ancient art, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture. He once wrote, “I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.”</p>\n<p>Seurat painted <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em> using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye. He began work on the canvas in 1884 (and included this date in the title) with a layer of small, horizontal brushstrokes in complementary colors. He next added a series of dots that coalesce into solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Sometime before 1889 Seurat added a border of blue, orange, and red dots that provide a visual transition between the painting’s interior and the specially designed white frame, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/articles/969/la-grande-jatte-frame-by-frame\">which has been re-created at the Art Institute</a>.</p>\n","short_description":"For his largest and best-known painting, Georges Seurat depicted Parisians enjoying all sorts of leisurely activities—strolling, lounging, sailing, and fishing—in the park called La Grande Jatte on the River Seine. He used an innovative technique called Pointillism that was inspired by optical and color theory, applying tiny dabs of different colored paint that viewers would see as a single, and Seurat believed, more brilliant hue.","dimensions":"207.5 × 308.1 cm (81 3/4 × 121 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":308.1,"width_in":121.25,"height_cm":207.5,"height_in":81.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower right: Seurat","credit_line":"Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>de Hauke 162</p>","publication_history":"Jules Christophe, Georges Seurat (Paris, 1890).\n\nGustave Kahn, “Seurat,” L’Art Moderne 11 (April 5, 1891), pp. 107-10.\n\nHenry van de Velde, “Georges Seurat,” La Wallonie 6 (March/April 1891), pp. 167-71.\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Mort de Georges Seurat,” La Nation (April 1, 1891).\n\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Georges Seurat,” La Société nouvelle (April 30, 1891), pp. 430-38.\n\nTéodor de Wyzewa, “Georges Seurat,” L’Art dans les Deux Mondes 22 (April 18, 1891), pp. 263-64.\n\nJules Christophe, “Seurat,” La Plume (September 1, 1891).\n\nPaul Signac, D’Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionnisme (Paris, 1899).\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Georges Seurat,” L’Art Moderne 15, 13 (April 1, 1900), p. 104.\n\nThadée Natanson, “Un Primitif d’aujourd’hui: Georges Seurat,” La Revue Blanche 21 (April 1900), pp. 610-14.\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Notes: Georges Seurat,” La Nouvelle Revue Française 1 (February 1, 1909), p. 92.\n\nRoger Fry, “The Post-Impressionsists,” in Manet and the Post-Impressionists, exh. cat.

Van Gogh conceived the first <em>Bedroom</em> in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.</p>\n","short_description":"In 1888, Van Gogh moved into his own homee in Arles, France. He dubbed it the “Studio of the South,” hoping that fellow artists would join him there to work. This is one of three versions he painted of his beloved Arles bedroom.

After an extended stay in Europe, which ended when he established his studio in New York City in 1878, Chase demonstrated his extraordinary versatility, painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and genre scenes. His vigor as an artist was equaled by his long and successful career as a teacher: his classes at the Art Students League in New York and the Shinnecock Hills Summer School on Long Island attracted many students.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1880s, Chase embarked on a group of plein-air paintings inspired by New York's parks. Influenced by the brilliant colors and unorthodox compositional formats of the French Impressionists, he often countered a broad, comparatively empty foreground with a detailed background. In this painting, which probably depicts Brooklyn’s Tompkins Park, almost half the canvas is filled by the wide, empty walkway, which, with its strong diagonal borders, carries the eye into the composition. This swift movement into space is slowed by the woman on the bench, who appears to gaze expectantly toward someone approaching along the path. To the left, colorful flowers provide a contrast to the bare walk at the right. This informal, seemingly spontaneous work, capturing the sparkle, light, and activity of a summer day, testifies to the freshness and vitality that Chase brought to the painting of such scenes.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"34.6 × 49.9 cm (13 5/8 × 19 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":49.9,"width_in":19.625,"height_cm":34.6,"height_in":13.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, lower right: \"Wm M.

Here Mount portrayed a boisterous group of patrons in a country tavern. The seated men encourage the drunken dance of the central figure, whose tattered clothes and inebriated state suggest a less fortunate position. Standing in the back corner is an African American figure, who, as a free black man in 1830s New York, was able to frequent the public tavern, but, as Mount makes clear visually, did not participate fully or equally in this community.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"57.4 × 69.7 cm (22 5/8 × 27 7/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":69.7,"width_in":27.4375,"height_cm":57.4,"height_in":22.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, lower left: \"W.

This canvas, one of six in a series, combines a Mediterranean cityscape with still-life objects. Familiar elements appear in many of de Chirico’s paintings like pieces of a mysterious puzzle: a classical arcade, oddly oversize artichokes, a cannon and cannonballs, a clock, an industrial brick chimney, a monumental tower, a running train, and a square-rigged sailing ship. Here the stage set for this extraordinary juxtaposition of objects is an Italian piazza, virtually deserted except for the menacing shadowy figures outside the edge of the scene.</p>\n<p>De Chirico represented objects with a matter-of-fact, though intentionally crude, precision. He painted his scenes flatly, in bright colors, and illuminated them with a cold white light. Rendered in this clear style, works like <em>The Philosopher’s Conquest</em> seem rife with meaning, though they remain resolutely enigmatic. Indeed, by juxtaposing incongruous objects, the artist sought to produce a metaphysical quality, what he called “art that in certain aspects resembles . . . the restlessness of myth.” De Chirico’s works would profoundly affect the Surrealists, who in the 1920s and 1930s attempted to portray dreams and images of the subconscious in their work.</p>\n","short_description":"Giorgio de Chirico's The Philosopher’s Conquest seems rife with meaning yet remains resolutely enigmatic.

With both philosophy and psychology in mind, the artist challenged himself to juxtapose two images in such a way that they would suggest in the viewer’s mind a third un-pictured thing. Here he connected two highly disparate objects—a train and a fireplace—in a composition that became one of his most iconic works. Although the fireplace is domestic and the train is industrial, they are linked by the smoke. Magritte understood that viewers would connect the locomotive’s billowing exhaust with the plumes of smoke that travel up chimneys, uncovering the painting’s poetic secret.</p>\n","short_description":"A major figure of the Surrealist movement, René Magritte approached painting as a philosophical and poetic art.

The owner of the jade concession there, the merchant Khwaja Mu’in, visited the court of Mughal emperor Akbar in 1563 and presented him with jade pieces. The earliest Mughal jades reflect Timurid, Ottoman, Safavid, and Chinese influences, and the finest jade objects were produced during the Jahangir and Shah Jahan periods in the seventeenth century. Jade was used for eating and drinking vessels, jewelry, sword hilts and scabbards, belt buckles, mirrors, and hookah parts. Inlaying jade with gold and setting it with gems was a popular Mughal technique derived from earlier Timurid traditions in Iran and Central Asia.

Exhibiting Surrealist-inspired work aimed at subverting artistic conventions and standards of taste, these artists became part of the Chicago Imagist movement. Although each member developed a distinct style, collectively they shared an emphasis on intuition and spontaneity and an affection for wordplay and humor. In his earliest paintings, Nutt referenced popular culture, particularly painted store windows and pinball machines, through his choice of medium and support—acrylic paint on Plexiglas. In addition, many elements of his early style relate to the comic strip: hard, crisp forms stand out boldly against simple backgrounds. In <em>Miss E. Knows</em> he also appropriated a sequential format, incorporating small, framed images in the upper-left corner of the painting. The work depicts a grotesquely imagined, highly sexualized female figure—Nutt’s satire of ideal beauty. The artist included the cartoonish light beam across her eyes as a reference to the cinema. By attaching objects such as rubber tubing and a coat hook to its surface, Nutt heightened the Surrealist effect of this image.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"192.1 × 131.1 cm (75 5/8 × 51 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":131.1,"width_in":51.625,"height_cm":192.1,"height_in":75.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on Plexiglas with aluminum and rubber; in artist's painted frame","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Twentieth-Century Purchase Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Jim Nutt","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":42.8425,"color":{"h":54,"l":46,"s":82,"percentage":0.008061822662935194,"population":84},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":36059,"artist_title":"Jim Nutt","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[36059],"artist_titles":["Jim Nutt"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-154","PC-831","PC-827"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Chicago Artists","Essentials","SAIC Alumni and Faculty"],"term_titles":["painting","Plexiglas (TM)","painting (image making)","figures (representations)","contemporary","20th Century","rubber (material)","aluminum (metal)","acrylic paint","modern and contemporary art","women","anatomy","planes","nudes","cartoons","flashlights","bullets","abstract figures","men"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_ids":["TM-12062","TM-13130"],"style_titles":["contemporary","20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-12283","alt_subject_ids":["TM-8735","TM-12363","TM-12364","TM-8649","TM-8891","TM-12366","TM-12367","TM-12688","TM-10121"],"subject_ids":["TM-12283","TM-8735","TM-12363","TM-12364","TM-8649","TM-8891","TM-12366","TM-12367","TM-12688","TM-10121"],"subject_titles":["figures (representations)","women","anatomy","planes","nudes","cartoons","flashlights","bullets","abstract figures","men"],"material_id":"TM-13150","alt_material_ids":["TM-3827","TM-2685","TM-2407"],"material_ids":["TM-13150","TM-3827","TM-2685","TM-2407"],"material_titles":["Plexiglas (TM)","rubber (material)","aluminum (metal)","acrylic paint"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Chicago Artists","Essentials","SAIC Alumni and Faculty"],"image_id":"9899a234-117e-6463-de7e-d224e9f48ae1","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Miss E.

This figure sensitively captures a quiet moment in the life of a matronly equestrienne, who gently guides her horse. The animal’s powerful neck and flanks, long legs, trimmed mane, and decoratively tied tail are features distinctive to the handsome breeds that were brought to China from the empire’s northwestern frontiers as well as from sites as far west as the Aral Sea. Carefully twisted strands of clay realistically depict the fur-like texture of the animal’s saddle blanket. The woman’s full proportions—evident in the folds of her flowing, wide-sleeved robe, as well as in her plump cheeks and double chin—are enhanced by her loosely gathered coiffure, which is topped with a dangling forehead bun. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty. Stylistically, the woman closely resembles figures that archeologists have recently unearthed from the tombs of high-status individuals that are datable to about 740.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"56.2 × 48.2 × 39 cm (22 1/8 × 19 × 15 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":39,"depth_in":15.375,"width_cm":48.2,"width_in":19,"height_cm":56.2,"height_in":22.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Earthenware with polychrome pigments","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mrs. Potter Palmer","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Archives of Asian Art, 1970, p. 108-109.\nChen Wanli, Tao Yong [Ceramic Figures].

In 1912 Elmslie and his firm made additions to the house, including eight pieces of furniture. This elegant clock, whose works and nine chimes were imported from Germany, dates from this later commission. Its hands were executed by Chicago metalsmith Robert Riddle Jarvie according to Elmslie’s design. In his concern over creating an organic, harmonious relationship between the interior of a house and its exterior, the Scottish-born Elmslie found a staunch ally in designer George Niedecken, president of Niedecken-Walbridge, a firm based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which made the clock’s mahogany case.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"213.3 × 66 × 40 cm (84 × 26 × 15 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":40,"depth_in":15.75,"width_cm":66,"width_in":26,"height_cm":213.3,"height_in":84,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Mahogany with brass inlay","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mrs. Theodore D.

Inspired by the local flamenco tradition, Goncharova translated the fabric’s radial lines into the axes formed by the dancer’s hands, which fan outward in geometric vectors, building upon the abstract-cubist style she had developed in Moscow the decade before. After her time in Spain, the artist wrote, “It seems to me that out of all the countries I have visited, this is the only one where there is some hidden energy.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"200.7 × 88.9 cm (79 × 35 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":88.9,"width_in":35,"height_cm":200.7,"height_in":79,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"N.

William Henry Fox Talbot produced this image by placing botanical specimens on sensitized paper and exposing them to light. He made this groundbreaking discovery after his 1833 honeymoon on the shores of Lake Como, in Lombardy, Italy. Frustrated by his inability to draw his Italian surroundings accurately, Talbot recalled the fleeting images of external objects that appeared within a camera lucida (an optical prism that creates a superimposed image on an artist’s drawing surface) and wondered how he could make them “imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed upon the paper.” What resulted, two years later, were the first camera negatives. Unveiled in 1839 and called photogenic drawing, Talbot’s process was perfected two years later into the calotype (from the Greek word <em>kalos</em>, meaning “beautiful”). By the end of his life, Talbot—whose far-ranging interests included mathematics, botany, etymology, and ancient Assyria—had also discovered the basis of halftone printing, obtained twelve patents, and authored seven books, including one of the first photographically illustrated books, <em>The Pencil of Nature</em> (1844).</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"22.1 × 18 cm (8 3/4 × 7 1/8 in.); Mount: 29 × 21.5 cm (11 7/16 × 8 1/2 in.); Image/paper: 22.1 × 18.1 cm (8 11/16 × 7 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":18,"width_in":7.0867,"height_cm":22.1,"height_in":8.7008,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":21.5,"width_in":8.4646,"height_cm":29,"height_in":11.4174,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Mount"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":18.1,"width_in":7.125,"height_cm":22.1,"height_in":8.6875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Photogenic drawing","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Edward E.

During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as <em>doucai</em> (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"A: h. 5.7 cm (2 1/4 in.)\ndiam. 10.2 cm (4 in.)\n B: h.5.7 cm (2 1/4 in.)\ndiam.10.0 cm (3 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Porcelain painted in underglaze blue and overglaze enamels (doucai)","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Bequest of Henry C.

The harmonious elegance seen here is based on two dining rooms designed by Robert Adam, the successful eighteenth-century London architect whose precise and delicate interpretation of the antique (stimulated by then-recent excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii) dictated English taste for a quarter of a century. To insure perfect conformity, Adam undertook the entire design of a house and every detail of its interior, hiring cabinetmakers to execute furniture that blended Neoclassical elements with current English forms. Instead of using wood and wallpaper, Adam carved low-relief ornament in plaster against painted panels in the style of Roman stuccos, as seen in this dining room. His furniture was often gilded in the Continental fashion, as is the side table in this room. The landscape over the table, painted by one of the many artists that Mrs. Thorne commissioned for the project, is in the style of Claude Lorrain.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Scale 1 inch = 1 foot: 50.8 × 89.5 × 65.1 cm (20 × 35 1/4 × 25 11/16 in.); Interior, Scale 1 inch = 1 foot: 50.8 × 89.6 × 65.1 cm (20 × 35 1/4 × 25 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":65.1,"depth_in":25.63,"width_cm":89.5,"width_in":35.2363,"height_cm":50.8,"height_in":20,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Scale 1 inch = 1 foot"},{"depth_cm":65.1,"depth_in":25.625,"width_cm":89.6,"width_in":35.25,"height_cm":50.8,"height_in":20,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Interior, Scale 1 inch = 1 foot"}],"medium_display":"Miniature room, mixed media","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mrs. James Ward Thorne","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":6,"fiscal_year":1941,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":26.955,"color":{"h":39,"l":42,"s":64,"percentage":0.006843690117711469,"population":33},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 11","gallery_id":2147477257,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Miniature room","artwork_type_id":21,"department_title":"Applied Arts of Europe","department_id":"PC-9","artist_id":26086,"artist_title":"Narcissa Niblack Thorne","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[26086],"artist_titles":["Narcissa Niblack Thorne"],"category_ids":["PC-831","PC-825","PC-9"],"category_titles":["Essentials","Women artists","Applied Arts of Europe"],"term_titles":["miniature","georgian","construction","mixed media","interiors","european","thorne rooms","interior design","dinning rooms","furniture","chandeliers"],"style_id":"TM-5931","style_title":"georgian","alt_style_ids":["TM-4703"],"style_ids":["TM-5931","TM-4703"],"style_titles":["georgian","european"],"classification_id":"TM-591","classification_title":"miniature","alt_classification_ids":["TM-1393"],"classification_ids":["TM-591","TM-1393"],"classification_titles":["miniature","thorne rooms"],"subject_id":"TM-12285","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12215","TM-12376","TM-9132","TM-12377"],"subject_ids":["TM-12285","TM-12215","TM-12376","TM-9132","TM-12377"],"subject_titles":["interiors","interior design","dinning rooms","furniture","chandeliers"],"material_id":"TM-2527","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2527"],"material_titles":["mixed media"],"technique_id":"TM-4287","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-4287"],"technique_titles":["construction"],"theme_titles":["Essentials","Women artists"],"image_id":"416b87c8-515f-0066-5c44-b7562162f2c0","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"E-10: English Dining Room of the Georgian Period, 1770-90","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1941.1195"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["E-10: English Dining Room of the Georgian Period, 1770-90"],"weight":34074,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-07-25T11:31:28-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:21:15-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:40:33-06:00"}

Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” (nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enliven-ing the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"73.5 × 92.4 cm (28 15/16 × 36 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92.4,"width_in":36.375,"height_cm":73.5,"height_in":28.9375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed lower right:  Manet","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Paris, Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Exposition des oeuvres d’Édouard Manet, January 1884, cat. 31.\n\nThéodore Duret, Histoire d’Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1902), no. 70.\n\nThéodore Duret, Manet and the French Impressionists (London, 1910), p. 220, no. 220.\n\nAntonin Proust, Édouard Manet: Souvenirs (Paris, 1913), p. 54, no. 38.\n\nThéodore Duret, Histoire de Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1926), no. 70 (ill.).\n\nÉtienne Moreau-Nelaton, Manet: Raconté par Lui-Même (Paris, 1926), vol. 1, pp. 63, 79, fig. 69, vol. 2, fig. 344.\n\nAdolphe Tabarant, Manet, Histoire Catalographique (Paris, 1931), p. 131, no. 90.\n\nPaul Jamot and Georges Wildenstein, Manet (Paris, 1932), vol. 1, p. 128, no. 96, vol. 2, p. 197, fig. 406.\n\nThéodore Duret, Manet, trans.

It was fashioned like a miniature tomb, complete with a tiled roof and Romanesque columns. Adrian was revered as the patron saint of soldiers and a protector against the plague. A Roman officer in charge of the persecution of Christians, Adrian so admired the virtues of those whom he oppressed that he converted to their faith. After declaring himself a Christian, Adrian was arrested and brutally martyred in the early fourth century. Unflinchingly illustrated on the sides of this reliquary (and reinforced by the inscription) is the story of Adrian’s trial, his dismemberment, and the transport of his remains to a city near Constantinople by his devoted wife, Saint Natalia.</p>\n<p>The casket’s design was hammered out from the reverse on thin sheets of silver, a technique called repoussé. The figures were reduced to simple, monumental forms composed of convex bulges, reflecting the style of Romanesque relief sculpture and manuscript illumination in northern Spain.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"15.9 × 25.4 × 14.5 cm (6 1/4 × 10 × 5 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":14.5,"depth_in":5.75,"width_cm":25.4,"width_in":10,"height_cm":15.9,"height_in":6.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Silver and oak core","inscriptions":"Inscription: MARTIRIS EXIMINI SACRUM/QUI MARTIR FACTUS SPREVIT EUM/[JA]CET  HIC ADRIAN","credit_line":"Kate S.

Early in his career, he began to utilize the silk-screen process to transfer photographed images to canvas, creating multiple portraits of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as duplicated images of mass-produced products such as Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. In this example from his <em>Mao</em> series, Warhol melded his signature style with the scale of totalitarian propaganda to address the cult of personality surrounding the Chinese ruler Mao Zedong (1893–1976). Nearly fifteen feet tall, this towering work mimics the representations of the political figure that were ubiquitously displayed throughout China. Warhol’s looming portrait impresses us with the duality of its realistic qualities and its plastic artificiality. In contrast to the photographic nature of the image, garish colors are applied to Mao’s face like makeup. The gestural handling of color in the portrait shows Warhol at his most painterly.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"448.3 × 346.7 cm (176 1/2 × 136 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":346.7,"width_in":136.5,"height_cm":448.3,"height_in":176.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic, silkscreen ink, and pencil on linen","inscriptions":"No inscription.","credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Frank G.

First staged in 1934 with an all-black cast, the work featured a libretto by Gertrude Stein and striking cellophane sets and costumes by Stettheimer, which achieved instant notoriety.</p>\n<p>Stettheimer developed her unique blend of faux-naive art and avant-garde innovations during the 1910s. With little concern for proportion or perspective, the artist depicted fantastic scenes, combining past and present, real and imagined, near and far, which she populated with slim, stylized figures who seem to float or dance through space. In this painting, an ecstatic-looking Thomson, awash in a flood of supernatural light, gazes at a mask bearing Stein’s features, which seems to represent a source of inspiration. Alluding to music’s heavenly quality, this encounter between creative forces takes place on a bank of clouds, complete with a tiny stage and actors, lettered banners, and fluttering doves.</p>\n<p>The chained lion to the right of Thomson might refer to the power of music to soothe even savage beasts or to Saint Jerome and the Evangelist Mark, who are frequently depicted in the company of lions. Reinforcing the link between creativity and spirituality are banners that combine the names of two saints from the opera, Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Ávila, with those of Thomson and Stein. However, the artist’s own name—<em>Florine St.</em>—appears in reverse order to the others, perhaps a witty abbreviation of her signature. Stettheimer designed the scalloped frame, which appropriately sets off her fanciful vision.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"97.8 × 51.1 cm (38 1/2 × 20 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":51.1,"width_in":20.125,"height_cm":97.8,"height_in":38.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil, and possibly ink, on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed at lower right: FLORINE ST.\nDated at lower left: 1930\nInscribed and signed in black paint across top stretcher: VIRGIL THOMSON - BY Florine Stettheimer\nDated in pencil on left side stretcher: Feb. 12 1930","credit_line":"Gift of Virgil Thomson","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Dorothy Dayton, \"Before Designing Stage Settings She Painted Composer's Portrait, Then Florine Stettheimer Translated the Portrait into the Settings of Virgil Thomson's Opera,\" The New York Sun (March 24, 1934): 15.\n\nVirgil Thompson, \"Portrait of Florine Stettheimer,\" Americana Fantastica, 2nd series, no. 4 (Jan. 1943): 48 (ill).\n\nHenry McBride, \"Florine Stettheimer: A Reminiscence,\" View 5, no. 3 (Oct. 1945): 14.\n\nHenry McBride, Florine Stettheimer, exh. cat.

Materials were scarce and making utilitarian objects such as bedcoverings depended entirely on raw products that could be raised by a family or community. Yet indigenous forms of American needlework did develop, as can be seen in this masterful bed rug. Although the coiling tendrils of its design are reminiscent of motifs that appear in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English textiles, their application to a bedcovering and the technique of looped running stitches embroidered through a wool support fabric are typically American. The term <em>rugge</em> or <em>rugg</em> appears in colonial inventories, where it refers to a woven yardage fabric used to make bedcovers. Such pieces were unique to the Connecticut River Valley. The information provided by the needlework contributes to the rarity of this piece: the initials <em>H. J.</em> refer to its maker, Hannah Johnson, the daughter of Ebenezer and Anna Johnson. It is dated 1796 and carries the number 26, which indicates that Johnson was twenty-six years old when she made it.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"249.4 × 246.1 cm (98 1/4 × 97 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":246.1,"width_in":97,"height_cm":249.4,"height_in":98.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Wool, plain weave; with cut pile formed by wool yarns embroidered in looped running stitches","inscriptions":"Inscribed: 1796 / 26 / H J","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by the Needlework and Textile Guild","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Christa Charlotte Mayer. \"Masterpieces of Western Textiles from The Art Institute of Chicago\" (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1969), p. 160, pl. 127.\n\nChrista C.

An early work, taken before Cartier-Bresson was a professional photographer, this picture of the world in flux shows spontaneity, intuition, and a Surrealist whimsy. Cartier-Bresson’s keen sense of composition derived, in part, from his training as a painter, as well as an acknowledged indebtedness to André Kertész. Both photographers used a miniature Leica camera, which allowed for thirty-six exposures in quick succession and, because of its compact serviceability, acted as a true extension of the eye. So definite was Cartier-Bresson’s rapid-fire release of the shutter that he used the entire negative of the final print, unretouched and unmanipulated. This remarkable capacity to seize life’s calculated and coincidental ambiguities explains why his is one of the most influential visions of the twentieth century. In addition to his later celebrated photojournalistic works, Cartier-Bresson produced two films, published more than a dozen books, and in 1947 helped establish the collaborative photography agency Magnum.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 19.8 × 29.5 cm (7 13/16 × 11 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":29.5,"width_in":11.6142,"height_cm":19.8,"height_in":7.7953,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; inscribed verso, center, in blue ink \"Henri Cartier-Bresson, 31 rue de Lisbonne, Paris 8\";\nverso, center, in pencil: \"1\" [encircled]; verso, bottom right, in red pencil: \"B 418\"; verso, lower bottom, in pencil: \"37.648 J.

Within the austere clarity of these simple geometric forms—common manufactured items that Mondrian used daily—Kertész captured the essence of this master of abstraction, both his aspirations to order and his slight and human divergences from it. The insistent angularity of the stark white table is offset by the sculptural curves of the glasses, bowl, and pipe, curves that were rigorously excluded from Mondrian’s art. Throughout Kertész’s long career, he sought the revelation of the found still life, of an abstract or resonating image discovered in an elliptical view. His signature practice of snaring and fixing these lyrical perceptions was facilitated by his later use of light, portable handheld cameras that enabled him to remain mobile and agile even when making still lifes.

Subtly graded shades of gray wash evoke the gloomy, overcast days so common in Germany in November, when this image was created. The drawing also conveys, in the artist’s words, “Not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him.” In the center of the landscape, atop the highest peak, a tiny pilgrim kneels in prayer at the base of a statue of the Madonna. Nature—with its sheer, blank sky, stark hills, and mute firs—is depicted almost religiously. In this deeply spiritual image, humankind’s experience of nature seems as overwhelming as the unfathomable mystery of our existence. Just as the infinitesimal pilgrim wanders in this faraway, expansive landscape, so too did the artist embark upon his own Romantic quest, a search for meaning in the natural world that reveals the sacred.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"24.4 × 38.2 cm (9 5/8 × 15 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":38.2,"width_in":15.0394,"height_cm":24.4,"height_in":9.6063,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Brush and black ink and gray wash, with graphite, on cream wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Margaret Day Blake Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Helmut Bösch-Supan and Karl Wilhelm Jähnig, Caspar David Friedrich: Genälde, Druckgraphik und bildmäßige Zeichnungen (Munich, 1973), pp. 280-81, no. 119 (ill.). \n\nHarold Joachim, \"A Drawing by Caspar David Friedrich,\" Bulletin of The Art Institute of Chicago 70:5 (September-October 1976), pp. 18-19 (ill.).\n\nJames N.

The secretary shares characteristics with the Empire style developed in France, a bolder and more severe expression of the Neoclassical interest in ancient Greek and Roman art. Though craftsmen throughout Europe studied French handbooks detailing new designs, models were not merely imitated; this example was made with materials and techniques typical of Viennese workshops. Its form has no direct source in antiquity, although the lyre shape and abundant decorative details—griffins, cornucopias, paw feet, and interior caryatid figures—are familiar classical motifs. The variety of woods, selected to create contrast between light areas and dark borders, matches the pastiche of decorative forms. Vienna was a major European design center in the early nineteenth century, and this desk type enjoyed wide popularity.

Showing the heritage of ancient and Byzantine models, it bears all the stylistic hallmarks of the beginning of the Gothic style in the region around the year 1200. The object’s origin was the subject of heated scholarly debate for several decades. Neutron activation analysis has shown that the limestone came from a quarry that also supplied stone for other carvings on Notre-Dame. The discovery of sculptural fragments from the cathedral’s Gallery of Kings above the west portals, dated to between 1220 and 1235 (and now in the Musée National du Moyen Âge, Paris), provided an important point of comparison. The Art Institute’s head is said to have been found during excavations for the modernization of Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. Medieval sculpture from Notre-Dame was purposefully damaged in the 1790s during the French Revolution because of its presumed royal associations. Fragments of some of the sculpture removed at the order of the revolutionary tribunal were buried out of a lingering respect for its tradition and quality, to be rediscovered in later years.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"H.: 43 cm (17 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":43,"height_in":17,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Limestone","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

Ruins of their spectacular cliff dwellings and multistory towns of sandstone masonry are widely scattered in northern New Mexico, Arizona, and southern parts of Utah and Colorado. Skilled farmers, the Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) were also creative artisans, as seen in this large, striking olla, a storage vessel. Dramatically decorated in the black-on-white ground of the Black Mesa style, the vessel displays a continuous swirling band of barbed, interlocking S shapes. This strong rhythmic pattern is best perceived from above, suggesting that the olla’s usual placement was on the floor. Like most ollas, this vessel originally had a taller neck, which broke off and was ground down by its owner. In Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) tradition, as among the Pueblos today, ceramic vessels were primarily made by women. The potter’s wheel was unknown, and skilled artisans created the evenly thin walls of their vessels by the coiling method. In this technique, the pot is built up with successive coils of clay that are then patted and thinned to achieve the final globular shape. Designs are painted using liquefied clay slips with mineral colors before firing the vessel in an open environment instead of a kiln.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"43.2 × 45.7 cm (17 × 18 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":45.7,"width_in":18,"height_cm":43.2,"height_in":17,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ceramic and pigment","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Tillie C.

Philip intended this monastery as a dynastic burial place, and he and his successors endowed it with artistic treasures. The triptych was a collaboration between two important artists from the Flemish territories controlled by Philip the Bold: the sculptor Jacques de Baerze and the painter Melchior Broederlam. When open, the altarpiece showed carved reliefs of the Crucifixion, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Entombment together with standing figures of saints. The gilded center could be covered by movable wings whose backs, painted with scenes from the Infancy of Christ by Broederlam, were visible when the altarpiece was closed. The triptych still survives in Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), but the central figure of the crucified Christ was removed during the French Revolution. Even separated from its context within the altarpiece, however, the crucified Christ remains a powerfully expressive work. Christ’s tensed hands and feet and earthy features are realistically observed, while the curving contour of his torso and the folds of his loincloth reflect a more courtly ideal.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"27.7 × 18.3 × 5.2 cm (11 × 6 1/4 × 2 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":5.2,"depth_in":2.0625,"width_cm":18.3,"width_in":6.25,"height_cm":27.7,"height_in":11,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Walnut with gilding and traces of polychromy","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Honoré Palmer","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Henri Chabeuf, \"Compte rendu des travaux de la Commission Départementale des Antiquités de la Côte-d’Or du 15 novembre 1907 au 1er julliet 1908,\" Mémoires de la Commission Départementale des Antiquités de la Côte-d’Or 15 (1906-10), pp. 122–24, ill. opp. p. 124.\n\nPaul Vitry, “Le Christ de Jacques de Baerze,” Annales du XXe Congrès archéologique et historique de Belge 1 (1907), p. 1 ff.\n\nPaul Vitry, “Travaux des Sociétés savantes,” Revue de l’art chrétien 4, 3 (1908), p. 199.\n\nDomien Roggen, “De Twee Retabels van de Baerze te Dijon,” Gentsche Bijdragen tot de Kunstgeschiedenis 1 (1934), pp. 98 n. 6, 99–100.\n\n“Gothic Sculpture for Chicago,” Antiques 50, 1 (1946), p. 52 (ill.).\n\nOswald Goetz, “Der Gekreuzigte des Jacques de Baerze,” Festschrift zum 60.

A designer of costumes and stage decorations for the French opera, he was also the superintendent of buildings and designer of Garde-Meuble for the Duc d’Orléans. Dugourc was the most outstanding interior decorator of his time, and from 1774 to 1790 he produced designs for the silk manufacturer Camille Pernon of Lyon. Educated in Italy for a time, Dugourc was familiar with the classical antique motifs that Raphael had revived in his fresco decorations for the Vatican Loggie, part of the papal palace in Rome. In fact, the French designer titled a group of textile patterns <em>Verdures of the Vatican. The Pheasants</em>, which was designed for the Spanish royal palace in Madrid, is part of this series. The elaborate composition encompasses a lavish, symmetrical interplay of birds, baskets, strings of pearls, garlands, and ribbons—all realized with the excellence of workmanship that made French silks so desirable.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"242.5 × 44.5 cm (95 1/4 × 17 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":44.5,"width_in":17.5,"height_cm":242.5,"height_in":95.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Silk, satin weave with plain interlacings of secondary binding warps and brocading wefts; embroidered with silk in chain (tambour work) and satin stitches","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mrs. Chauncey B.

The artist’s rapid, virtuoso draftsmanship evokes forms with what seems like a minimum of effort, and his powerful handling of brush and wash reflects his ability to capture the effects of light. The interplay between the drawing’s broad, free underdrawing and its shimmering veils of wash lend this work its charm and vivacity.

Brilliantly colored and adorned with flicker feathers and dyed cotton string, these effigies once formed an altar as agents for communion with the life-giving spirits of the earth and sky. The large male figure, with his feather necklace and bold black-and-turquoise zigzag pattern, features sky symbolism. The smaller, female figure is a more self-contained form, probably corresponding to the earth. Her ocher color likely refers to maize and pollen, symbols of sustenance and fertility. The accompanying figures are a mountain lion (the chief predator in the region) and two serpents (carved from cottonwood roots), representing agents of communication with the earth and the seasonal cycle of fertility. Curved wooden throwing sticks for rabbit hunting complete the ensemble. Testimony to the antiquity and endurance of the worship of earth and sky and to the spiritual bonds between people and animals, these objects bear close resemblance to ritual figures and implements still used today among the diverse Pueblo peoples.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Male figure: H.: 64 cm (25 1/4 in.); Female figure: H.: 36 cm (14 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":64,"height_in":25.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Male figure"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":36,"height_in":14.1875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Female figure"}],"medium_display":"Wood, stone, plant fibers, cotton, feathers, hide, and pigment","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Major Acquisitions Centennial Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Henry Jerome Walt, \"An Effigy Cache from the Cliff Valley, New Mexico\" (unpublished MA Thesis, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, 1978).\n\nAlan G.

Usually early in the morning, Atget hauled a large view camera, a wood tripod, and heavy glass plates around the city to do his work. In <em>Fête du trône</em>, the photographer captured a curious window display featuring articles associated with a giant and a midget, a sort of ready-made Surrealism. In 1925, the year this photograph was taken, Atget was discovered by the expatriate American artist and photographer Man Ray, who was part of the Surrealist circle of poets and artists in Paris. With Man Ray’s support, Atget’s work began to be published and recognized as more than just a visual history of Paris. Upon Atget’s death, Man Ray’s assistant, the photographer Berenice Abbott, acquired the more than eight thousand prints found in his studio and devoted decades to promoting his vast and remarkable oeuvre. The funds for Abbott’s purchase were supplied by Julien Levy, a prominent dealer of photography and Surrealism, the core of whose photographic collection is held at the Art Institute.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 18 × 22.6 cm (7 1/8 × 8 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":22.6,"width_in":8.8977,"height_cm":18,"height_in":7.0867,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver printed-out print","inscriptions":"Printed recto, lower left, in black, backwards: \"68\"; verso unchecked","credit_line":"Julien Levy Collection, Special Photography Acquisition Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Travis, David. 1976. “Photographs from the Julien Levy Collection: Starting with Atget.” Exh. cat.

With this increased demand, talented sign painters such as Ammi Phillips saw new opportunities. Phillips taught himself to be a limner—a painter of portraits. By 1811 he had learned painting techniques from other Connecticut limners, who executed full-length, three-quarter, and bust portraits on canvas, wood, and glass. Phillips began to use conventional poses adopted from European prints and became one of the most successful portraitists of the middle and upper classes in rural New England, plying his trade in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.</p>\n<p>Here Phillips depicted Dr. Cornelius Allerton seated in a painted chair against a somber, gray background. Although the sitter's face is relatively unmodeled, the artist's careful rendering of detail captures a sense of his individuality. The inclusion of a volume of <em>Parr's Medical Dictionary</em> conveys Allerton's profession, while a tiny horse in the distance may suggest his financial status. Itinerant painters such as Phillips were often commissioned to portray several members of a family; in this case, Phillips also completed portraits of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/55710/mrs-reuben-allerton-lois-atherton\">Allerton's mother</a> (1946.395) and mother-in-law (Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford). This painting was given to the Art Institute by Robert Allerton, the sitter's great-nephew and an important benefactor of the museum.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"83.8 × 69.9 cm (33 × 27 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":69.9,"width_in":27.5,"height_cm":83.8,"height_in":33,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Robert Allerton","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Leigh Rehner Jones and Shirley A.

Robert has studied in Rome from 1754 to 1765 and there had gleaned his artistic vocabulary. Like the other three large paintings from the group painted for Méréville, all in the Art Institute, <em>The Fountains</em> exploits Robert’s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space. The four paintings are inhabited by tiny figures in the foreground; these serve only to set the scale and animate the scene, for the ruins themselves are the true subject of the pictures. In his use of ruins, Robert embodied the notion of the relationship of mankind and the built environment to nature that was expressed by the French philosopher and encyclopedist Denis Diderot: “Everything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.”</p>\n","short_description":"In his paintings of ruins, Hubert Robert embodied French philosopher Denis Diderot's notion that \"Everything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.\" This work, one of four canvases commissioned for a wealthy financier’s château (all now in the Art Institute's collection), exploits Robert’s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space.","dimensions":"255.3 × 221.2 cm (100 1/2 × 88 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":221.2,"width_in":88.125,"height_cm":255.3,"height_in":100.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of William G.

Festooned with ormolu (gilt bronze) swirls and floral swags, the clock required the collaboration of numerous specialized artisans. Its case, candelabra, and wall bracket were created by the eminent Jean-Pierre Latz, who was appointed <em>ébéniste</em> (furniture maker) to the king in 1741. The clock’s eight-day movement was manufactured in the Flemish city of Ghent by Francis Bayley, possibly a member of the large London dynasty of clockmakers of that name. Opulent clocks such as this did more than tell time; they delighted the ear with music (six melody titles are engraved in the dial’s arch) and dazzled the eye with dramatic scenes. Here the Greek god Apollo is poised at the top of the clock case to slay the serpent Python. The space between the clock and the wall bracket was cleverly used to suggest the beast’s home, the cave of Mount Parnassus in Greece. In the triangular base are the faces of Zeus, symbolizing time, and Hera, presiding over marriage and childbirth. They are surmounted by two small coats of arms belonging to the Flemish bride and groom whose union the clock was probably created to celebrate.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"147.3 × 64.8 × 53.3 cm (58 × 25 1/4 × 21 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":53.3,"depth_in":21,"width_cm":64.8,"width_in":25.25,"height_cm":147.3,"height_in":58,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oak, tortoiseshell, kingwood, brass, gilt bronze, and glass","inscriptions":"Mark: \"Francis Bayley, Ghendt\"","credit_line":"Ada Turnbull Hertle Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Henry Hawley, \"Jean-Pierre Latz, Cabinetmaker,\" The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Vol. 57, No. 7 (Sep-Oct 1970): pp. 226-27, cat. no. 14 (ill.).\n\nJohn Keefe, \"An Eighteenth Century French Wall Clock Attributed to Jean-Pierre Latz,\" Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Jan-Feb 1976): pp. 4-7 (ill.).\n\nJohn Keefe, Selected Works of 18th Century French Art in the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1976); p. 151; cat. no. 252 (ill.).\n\nIan Wardropper and Lynn Springer Roberts, European Decorative Arts in the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1991), pp. 54 (detail), 55-56, 57 (ill.).\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, The Essential Guide, 4th Edition, (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2015), p. 132 (ill.).","exhibition_history":"AIC, Selected Works of 18th Century French Art in the Collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, January 24 to March 28, 1976.","provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":6,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":43.424,"color":{"h":38,"l":45,"s":63,"percentage":0.011286981462792795,"population":102},"latitude":41.8794566826592,"longitude":-87.6231896504759,"latlon":"41.879456682659,41.879456682659","is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 233","gallery_id":25288,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Furniture","artwork_type_id":6,"department_title":"Applied Arts of Europe","department_id":"PC-9","artist_id":14830,"artist_title":"Jean Pierre Latz","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[14830],"artist_titles":["Jean Pierre Latz"],"category_ids":["PC-9","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Applied Arts of Europe","Essentials"],"term_titles":["glass","furniture","furniture","gilding","clock","european decorative arts","animals","coat of arms","bows and arrows","clocks","floral motifs","gold (color)","men","script"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-76","classification_title":"furniture","alt_classification_ids":["TM-565","TM-1394"],"classification_ids":["TM-76","TM-565","TM-1394"],"classification_titles":["furniture","clock","european decorative arts"],"subject_id":"TM-9132","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12218","TM-10481","TM-12706","TM-12360","TM-12631","TM-11859","TM-10121","TM-12579"],"subject_ids":["TM-9132","TM-12218","TM-10481","TM-12706","TM-12360","TM-12631","TM-11859","TM-10121","TM-12579"],"subject_titles":["furniture","animals","coat of arms","bows and arrows","clocks","floral motifs","gold (color)","men","script"],"material_id":"TM-2453","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2453"],"material_titles":["glass"],"technique_id":"TM-3887","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3887"],"technique_titles":["gilding"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"ce583554-7fac-705e-2130-ec94c1abb2e2","alt_image_ids":["d9f13327-b1f1-3a6f-f59a-0844acfaaab9"],"document_ids":["a0f85e4f-2a9c-f704-4d48-7dc91ff6a449"],"sound_ids":["a0f85e4f-2a9c-f704-4d48-7dc91ff6a449"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Wall Clock","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1975.172"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Wall Clock"],"weight":2475,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-20T15:55:06-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:23:49-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:41:11-06:00"}

(In India and Tibet, she is often shown standing and with two arms.) The goddess’s complexion is depicted as golden in sculpture and yellow in painting, a symbol of her wealth-giving attributes.

Chagall stressed Jesus’s religious identity by depicting him and the biblical figures above him in traditional Jewish garments. The surrounding images show the devastation of pogroms, violent attacks against Jewish communities often organized or sanctioned by local governments. Combining the Crucifixion with contemporary events, Chagall’s painting links the martyred Jesus with the Jewish people being persecuted across Europe and implicitly compares the Nazis with Jesus’s tormentors.</p>\n","short_description":"This work is one of the most overtly political paintings of Chagall's career.

His evocative classical landscapes were sought after by papal patrons as well as by aristocrats and royalty throughout Europe. For nearly a century after his death, travelers on the grand tour of European capitals judged real scenery according to his standards. In Claude’s landscapes, as in this superb drawing, order and tranquility prevail; men perform no labor but rather exist peacefully in beautiful pastoral settings blessed by the warm Roman light. Depicted here is the region around the Sasso, a large rock ten miles south of Civitavecchia, Rome’s modern seaport. Evidently made at the site of the rock itself, the drawing is remarkable in its mastery of subtle ink washes that evocatively suggest, rather than describe, the landscape and sea. Individual trees stand out as nearly geometric forms against the unifying light. The drawing’s horizontal format enhances the idyllic landscape’s panoramic sweep, which the viewer savors along with the solitary shepherd.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"16.2 × 40.2 cm (6 7/16 × 15 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":40.2,"width_in":15.8268,"height_cm":16.2,"height_in":6.378,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Pen and brown ink with brush and brown wash, heightened with white gouache and traces of white chalk, over black chalk and graphite, on cream laid paper","inscriptions":"Inscribed verso, center, in pen and brown ink: \"lo sasso Claudio Gillee/I-V fecit\"","credit_line":"Helen Regenstein Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Marcel Roethlisberger, \"Neun Zeichnungen von Claude Lorrain,\" Du 33 (July 1973), p. 516 (ill.).\n\nMarcel Roethlisberger, \"A Panoramic View of Claude Lorrain,\" The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 11 (Spring 1985), pp. 103-16 (ill.).\n\nJames N.

In <em>Ballet at the Paris Opéra</em>, the artist creatively joined the monotype technique, rarely used in his time, with the fragile medium of pastel. Described as “the powder of butterfly wings,” pastel was the perfect medium to illustrate the onstage metamorphosis of spindly young dancers into visions of beauty as perfect and short-lived as butterflies. This work, executed on one of the widest monotype plates ever used by the artist, bears Degas’s characteristically cropped forms and odd vantage points, which effectively convey the immediacy of the scene. The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers’ zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, <em>en pointe</em>, but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers’ free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The Paris Opéra was the official school of the first state-supported ballet, the Académie Royale de Danse, created in 1661.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Plate: 35.2 × 70.6 cm (13 7/8 × 27 13/16 in.); Sheet: 35.9 × 71.9 cm (14 3/16 × 28 5/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":70.6,"width_in":27.7953,"height_cm":35.2,"height_in":13.8583,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Plate"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":71.9,"width_in":28.3071,"height_cm":35.9,"height_in":14.1339,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Pastel over monotype on cream laid paper","inscriptions":"Signed recto, lower left, in white pastel: \"Degas\"","credit_line":"Gift of Mary and Leigh Block","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Paul André Lemoisne, Degas et son Oeuvre (Paris, 1946), no. 513 (ill.).\n\nJean Sutherland Boggs, “Degas Monotypes at the Fogg,” The Burlington Magazine 110:784 (July 1968), pp. 429-430 (ill).\n\nFiorella Minervino, L'Opera Completa di Degas (Milan, 1970), no. 724.\n\nGeorge T.M.

Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.”</p>\n<p>Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like <em>Sunset</em> reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"46.1 × 70.5 cm (18 1/8 × 27 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":70.5,"width_in":27.75,"height_cm":46.1,"height_in":18.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.l.: \"Klee\"","credit_line":"Gift of Mary and Leigh Block","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Will Grohmann, Paul Klee (Harry N.

In his efforts to make the sculpture symbolic of the building’s purpose, Storrs turned to the Classical subject of Ceres, the Roman goddess of grain, alluding to the board’s activity as the world’s biggest grain exchange. He depicted Ceres holding a sheaf of wheat in one hand and a grain sample bag in the other. Storrs also synchronized his sculpture with the building’s Art Deco architecture, emphasizing the figure’s streamlined form and employing modern materials. <em>Ceres</em> garnered a great deal of praise; a contemporary review stated that “this work has been described by some of the nation’s leading architects as one of the finest pieces of architectural sculpture to be found in America.” Perhaps in reaction to such favorable notices, Storrs produced smaller versions of the sculpture, such as this one.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"67.3 × 16.2 × 12.4 cm (26 1/2 × 6 3/8 × 4 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":12.4,"depth_in":4.875,"width_cm":16.2,"width_in":6.375,"height_cm":67.3,"height_in":26.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Copper-alloy plated with nickel, then chrome","inscriptions":"Inscribed on back of base: STORRS/cast by/American Art Bronze Foundry/Chicago.","credit_line":"Gift of John N.

Individuals all different, all wanting different things, all knowing different things, all loving different things, all looking different. . . . That is what I love: the differentness.” Arbus’s appreciation for the unusual, eccentric, and extraordinary led her to photograph a range of subjects over the thirty years of her career—transvestites, giants, art philanthropists, nudists, and, as here, similarly dressed and made-up women. These ladies, with their cigarettes poised in one hand and lighters clutched in the other, occupy a booth in a New York City automat. (Now nearly obsolete and a nostalgic choice even in the 1960s, automats offered simple fare, sold from coin-operated vending machines, that was eaten at surrounding booths and counters.) Like many of Arbus’s subjects, these women were photographed in a straightforward manner. The eerily matched ladies face the camera head-on, posed in front of an unadorned marble wall and staring directly at the viewer. The candor with which Arbus presented these women is typical of the pioneering, powerful first-person directness that exists throughout her photography.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image: 37.5 × 37.5 cm (14 13/16 × 14 13/16 in.); Paper: 50.5 × 40.5 cm (19 15/16 × 16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":37.5,"width_in":14.7638,"height_cm":37.5,"height_in":14.7638,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":40.5,"width_in":15.9449,"height_cm":50.5,"height_in":19.8819,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Paper"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; stamped verso, upper left, in black ink: \"Not to be reproduced in any way without written permission from Doon Arbus\"; stamped, inscribed and signed verso, upper right, in black ink: \"A Diane Arbus photograph / title [stamped] THE LADIES AT THE AUTOMAT, / N.

Using a giant wet-plate camera whose thick glass negatives—coated with a sensitized emulsion called collodion and exposed while still wet—were often as large as the average easel painting of the time, Watkins here fused a sense of the picturesque with a Romantic expression of nature’s timelessness, immensity, and silence. The trees are sharply defined, still, and majestic. Depicted with equal clarity is the river, which winds into the receding hills. This technical and aesthetic perfection was all the more remarkable considering the difficulty of the wet-plate process for a frontier photographer. In the field, Watkins had to transport (with the aid of several pack mules) mammoth cameras, dark tents, chemicals, and as many as four hundred glass plates. He also had to contend with constant packing and unpacking, the lack of pure water, and the tendency of dust to adhere to the sticky collodion. Photographs such as <em>Big River</em> and Watkins’s famous views of Yosemite (which helped persuade the US Congress to pass legislation protecting the valley’s wilderness) provided the world with some of the first glimpses of the American West.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"40 × 52.5 cm (15 3/4 × 20 11/16 in.); Mount: 55 × 68.4 cm (21 11/16 × 26 15/16 in.); Image/paper: 40.1 × 52.6 cm (15 3/4 × 20 11/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":52.5,"width_in":20.6693,"height_cm":40,"height_in":15.7481,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":68.4,"width_in":26.9292,"height_cm":55,"height_in":21.6536,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Mount"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":52.6,"width_in":20.6875,"height_cm":40.1,"height_in":15.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Albumen print","inscriptions":"Printed recto, on mount, below image, lower center, in India ink calligraphic script in the style of Fulgenzio Seregni [style note from Naef]: “Mendocino River / from the Rancherie, Mendocino, Cal.” verso unchecked","credit_line":"Gift of the Auxiliary Board","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Wood, James N. and Teri J.

To achieve this, he limited his subject matter to, in his words, “rivers, streams, the rippling brook, the hillside, the sky, the clouds.” For half a century, the artist captured these moisture-laden subjects in all seasons, during all hours of the day and night. First he made small, quick sketches in the field or wood, and then, in the seclusion of his studio, he used them to create the more than one thousand oils credited to him.</p>\n<p>Inness completed <em>The Home of the Heron</em> near the end of his career, after he had finally achieved a degree of comfort and success. The painting is characteristic of his late work, with loosely rendered detail and dim objects that seem bathed in an almost incandescent glow. The picture’s blurred outlines, broad handling, and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the heron, masterfully evoke nature’s stillness and mystery. With more than two dozen canvases by Inness, the Art Institute has one of the most comprehensive collections of the painter’s work.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"76.2 × 115.2 cm (30 × 45 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":115.2,"width_in":45,"height_cm":76.2,"height_in":30,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, lower right: \"G.

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"60 × 100.5 cm (23 5/8 × 39 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":100.5,"width_in":39.5625,"height_cm":60,"height_in":23.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower left: Claude Monet 91","credit_line":"Gift of Arthur M.

Moser was also a founder of the Vienna Secession, the association of young artists who had broken away from the Wiener Künstlerhaus, the accepted artistic forum of the time. <em>Poppyheads</em>, designed by Moser three years before the Wiener Werkstätte was formed, foreshadowed the kind of elegant textile designs he would produce at the Werkstätte. The attenuated lines coupled with the simplification and abstraction of organic forms demonstrate a new aesthetic vision of the time shared by artists and designers in Vienna and Glasgow. Moser’s design was produced in various colors by the Viennese firm of Johann Backhausen und Söhne, which was closely linked to the Werkstätte and is still in business today. The textile was intended for upholstery or curtain fabric, ideally for rooms whose design and furnishings would be produced as total environments by Werkstätte artists.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"182.9 × 113 cm (72 × 44 1/2 in.); Repeat: 45.5 × 29.8 cm (17 7/8 × 11 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":113,"width_in":44.5,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":29.8,"width_in":11.75,"height_cm":45.5,"height_in":17.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Repeat"}],"medium_display":"Silk, wild silk, and cotton, satin weave self-patterned by ground weft floats","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mrs. Julian Armstrong, Jr.","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Gronwoldt, Ruth.

In the <em>Popol Vuh</em>, a sixteenth-century epic of the K’iche’ Maya, the death and resur¬rection of the maize god was likened to seed corn that sprouted and produced new life. This vessel from the Late Classic period (600–800) depicts a Maya ruler attired as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. On his back, the ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems. Just as maize plants sway to and fro, the maize god dances to the rhythm of life—often, as seen here, in the company of a dwarf. Among the Maya, dwarfs were seen as special beings with powerful spiritual connections to the earth and the interior world below. This vase refers to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased into the domain of the dead, from which it would eventually be reborn in the royal lineage, just as maize sprouts again in the cycle of nature’s renewal. This vase of the Dancing Lords may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>\n","short_description":"This eighth-century Maya vessel was made by Ah Maxam, a royal member of the Naranjo kingdom of Guatemala.

It would eventually be reborn, just as maize sprouts again in nature's cycle of renewal.","dimensions":"24 × 15.8 cm (9 1/2 × 6 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":15.8,"width_in":6.25,"height_cm":24,"height_in":9.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ceramic and pigment","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Ethel T.

He founded an exhibiting organization, the Photo-Secession, then the periodical <em>Camera Work</em>, and finally a series of galleries. The most influential of these, the gallery known simply as 291, operating from 1908 until 1917, introduced the work of such leaders of the European avant-garde as Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Georgia O’Keeffe, who became Stieglitz’s wife in 1924, was among the progressive American artists whose work he also exhibited at 291. In a search for objective truth and pure form, the innovative photographer took some five hundred photographs of O’Keeffe between 1917 and 1937. The essence of O’Keeffe, he felt, was not confined to her head and face alone; equally expressive were her torso, feet, and especially her hands, as seen here. What resulted is a “composite portrait” of the painter, in which each photograph, revealing her intrinsic nature at a particular moment, can stand alone as an independently expressive form. When these serial images are viewed as a whole, they portray the essence of O’Keeffe’s many different “selves.”</p>\n<p>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image: 24.4 × 19.4 cm (9 5/8 × 7 11/16 in.); Paper: 25.1 × 20.3 cm (9 15/16 × 8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":19.4,"width_in":7.6378,"height_cm":24.4,"height_in":9.6063,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":20.3,"width_in":7.9922,"height_cm":25.1,"height_in":9.8819,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Paper"}],"medium_display":"Palladium print","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; inscribed verso, lower right, in graphite: \"Ch / OK 3 B\"","credit_line":"Alfred Stieglitz Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Wood, James N. and Teri J.

This romantic silhouette portrait depicts Auguste Rodin seated in his studio opposite his famous work <em>Le Penseur</em>, with his sculpture of Victor Hugo in the background. In 1902, the year he made this photograph, Steichen believed he would become a painter, and he visited Rodin and his circle of artists and admirers often. But as a founding member of Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession group, Steichen increasingly created photographs that were the artistic equivalents of his paintings, in the hope of winning artistic credibility for the newer art form. Here the artist expertly manipulated the elastic and expressive gum-bichromate method, in which the application of water and brushwork in the printing process can soften or omit details, reduce dark spaces, and even change light into dark (and vice versa). The result is a combination of two separate images, both dramatically posed and lit, into a striking, painterly photograph.</p>\n<p>For more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/steichen/index.html\">Edward Steichen's World War I Years</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper/mount: 26.2 × 32.6 cm (10 3/8 × 12 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":32.6,"width_in":12.8347,"height_cm":26.2,"height_in":10.315,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper/mount"}],"medium_display":"Gum bichromate print","inscriptions":"Inscribed recto, lower left, in white pencil: Steichen / MDCCCCII; inscribed verso, on mount, upper right, sideways, in graphite: [ROD]IN \"LE PENSEUR / BY / STEICHEN; verso, on mount, center, sideways, in graphite: [?]roden [?/crossed out]; verso, on mount, upper left, diagonally, in graphite: 1/4 101 Brush / Aluminum Brz [?] tone / oak b[illegible] 131 / color / 3/8 101 Brush Aluminum Brz / tone; verso, on mount, upper left, in graphite: [drawing]; verso, on mount, lower left, sideways, in graphite: [drawing of matting instructions]; verso, on mount, lower left, sideways, in graphite: Steichen / if A as diag / Sr 10 1/4 x 12 3/4","credit_line":"Alfred Stieglitz Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Smith, Joel. 1999. “Edward Steichen : the early years.” Princeton University Press, Princeton N.J. p. 20, fig 13.\n\nSharp, Robert V., Elizabeth Stepina and Susan E.

It is a triumph of the collaborative practice of the Sèvres factory; documents reveal the precise roles played by each artist in its creation. Napoleon’s chief architect, Charles Percier, created the Etruscan scroll-handled design. The vase was commissioned by Napoleon in 1805 but was produced only in 1813 and was still at the factory when he was exiled the following year.

Characterized by its white body fabric, brilliant transparent glaze, and distinct decoration, Iznik pottery represents one of the most technologically refined and aesthetically arresting traditions in the history of Islamic ceramics. Here the decoration consists of a motif of hyacinths and carnations, underscored with blue tulips and red roses. The artist fully realized the rhythmic potential of alternating floral forms, exploiting the tankard’s tall, cylindrical surface to create a feeling of motion. Though the Iznik tradition seems to have been intially inspired by imported Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, by the 1550s, Iznik pottery had been transformed. Working in collaboration with the imperial Ottoman atelier in Istanbul (<em>nakkash-hane</em>), Iznik potters helped to create a style that epitomized an empire and was eventually sought after far from Istanbul. The tulip and carnation motif was particularly popular and appears on book bindings, paper borders, and textiles made for the Ottoman court. The craze for tulips was not limited to ornament, however. The real flowers were cultivated in Istanbul’s gardens, and the bulbs were exported to Europe. The size of this tankard even suggests that it may have once been used as a flower vase, perhaps to hold the very blossoms it depicts.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"19.6 × 15 × 10.5 cm (7 3/4 × 5 7/8 × 4 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":10.5,"depth_in":4.125,"width_cm":15,"width_in":5.875,"height_cm":19.6,"height_in":7.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Iznik ware, fritware with underglaze painting in blue, turquoise, red, and black","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mary Jane Gunsaulus Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":8,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":30.1471,"color":{"h":216,"l":38,"s":63,"percentage":0.01611495333378097,"population":144},"latitude":41.8796264310354,"longitude":-87.622124813497,"latlon":"41.879626431035,41.879626431035","is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Ceramics","artwork_type_id":36,"department_title":"Arts of Asia","department_id":"PC-7","artist_id":29882,"artist_title":"Islamic","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[29882],"artist_titles":["Islamic"],"category_ids":["PC-7","PC-832","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Arts of Asia","Drinking and Dining","Essentials"],"term_titles":["drinking vessel","fritware","iznik","underglazing","flora","earthenware","ceramic","asian art","ceramics","ottoman","drinking","vessel","Islamic (culture or style)"],"style_id":"TM-5789","style_title":"iznik","alt_style_ids":["TM-5729","TM-13482"],"style_ids":["TM-5789","TM-5729","TM-13482"],"style_titles":["iznik","ottoman","Islamic (culture or style)"],"classification_id":"TM-11734","classification_title":"drinking vessel","alt_classification_ids":["TM-74","TM-26","TM-46","TM-27"],"classification_ids":["TM-11734","TM-74","TM-26","TM-46","TM-27"],"classification_titles":["drinking vessel","earthenware","asian art","ceramics","vessel"],"subject_id":"TM-12108","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12077"],"subject_ids":["TM-12108","TM-12077"],"subject_titles":["flora","drinking"],"material_id":"TM-11966","alt_material_ids":["TM-2432"],"material_ids":["TM-11966","TM-2432"],"material_titles":["fritware","ceramic"],"technique_id":"TM-4197","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-4197"],"technique_titles":["underglazing"],"theme_titles":["Drinking and Dining","Essentials"],"image_id":"3836baeb-35c2-7ce9-be86-96a26595521e","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["2a141f37-e388-4f38-5fa3-34ce8e084453"],"sound_ids":["2a141f37-e388-4f38-5fa3-34ce8e084453"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Tankard (Hanap) with Tulips, Hyacinths, Roses, and Carnations","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1913.342"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Tankard (Hanap) with Tulips, Hyacinths, Roses, and Carnations"],"weight":1330,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-04-27T15:26:19-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T14:29:03-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:41:47-06:00"}

The real and mythical creatures on the vessel—birds, monkeys, bears, dragons, kneeling figures, and immortals riding dragons—all follow the iconography of early Chinese funerary art. Intermingled with these images, however, are depictions of the Buddha, who is identified by his meditating posture, topknot, and halo. The marginal role of Buddhist art in this decorative scheme reflects the adoption of the alien Indian religion, as the Chinese then understood it, into a hospitable mélange of different spiritual beliefs.

An inveterate self-portraitist, Corinth produced more images of himself than almost any other artist except Rembrandt van Rijn. In this haunting gouache, he gazes at the viewer in anguish. The brooding palette portrays a deeply shadowed face— contorted, haggard, and sunk into hunched shoulders. The pain that both the diary entry and this portrait convey is curiously at odds with Corinth’s professional life, which had, in fact, been successful. Challenging traditional approaches to art, his early figure compositions, with their overt sexuality and theatrical movements, made his reputation. Later he executed intensely colored, windswept landscapes that became his most popular works. But Corinth was a deeply patriotic man, and his personal accomplishments failed to assuage the torment he experienced after Germany’s humiliation in World War I and his despair over the values of the Weimar Republic that followed.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"48.6 × 30.5 cm (19 3/16 × 12 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":30.5,"width_in":12.0079,"height_cm":48.6,"height_in":19.1339,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Gouache, with possible additions in oil, on heavy ivory wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"James N.

Parted down the middle, his hair resembles an open book; finely incised parallel lines suggest that it has been meticulously combed, and a long double braid hangs down his back. His facial features are defined by raised eyebrows, high cheekbones, a tight mouth that curves slightly downward, and large pierced ears that project perpendicularly from his head. Evoking fierceness and shock, the man stares blankly ahead—like a subdued victim anticipating a terrifying, painful punishment. Figures with proportions and features similar to this sculpture have recently been unearthed at sites in southwestern Sichuan Province that date to the second millennium BC. Whereas those images were carved from more roughly textured stones and sometimes preserve traces of pigment, this example’s smooth, blackish-green surface appears unique. Scientific analyses indicate that the sculpture was probably darkened by burning before burial and, upon rediscovery, was polished and saturated with wax.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"19.6 × 7 × 9.8 cm (7 3/4 × 2 3/4 × 3 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":9.8,"depth_in":3.7,"width_cm":7,"width_in":2.75,"height_cm":19.6,"height_in":7.7,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Chlorite","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Edward and Louise B.

At center are a rooster and trophies, beneath which is the king’s monogram of double <em>L</em>s.

He set up a portrait studio with his muse and apprentice, Tina Modotti, who introduced him to such artists as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. Stimulated by the vital Mexican culture—as well as by his previous contacts with the great photographers Charles Sheeler, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand—Weston’s soft-focus, painterly style underwent a radical change. “The camera must be used for a recording of <em>life</em>,” he wrote during this period, “for rendering the very substance and quintessence of the <em>thing</em> itself.” This simple metal washbowl, which he stored under his sink, is an example of the new and unconventional subjects Weston began to photograph during his Mexican sojourn. In his obsession with clarity of form and precision of image, he pioneered a technique that he called “previsualizing”—looking at a scene through the camera and determining how that would translate to a print; any cropping, trimming, or enlarging of the print was rejected as a betrayal of vision. Here he captured the worn metal and porcelain surfaces of the washbowl and sink with sensuous, almost preternatural clarity. An important transitional piece, this work prefigures Weston’s exquisite and erotic studies of nudes, shells, and plant forms.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"24.3 × 18.9 cm (9 5/8 × 7 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":18.9,"width_in":7.441,"height_cm":24.3,"height_in":9.567,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Platinum print","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Harold L.

Hesse considered <em>Hang Up</em> among her most important works because it was the first to achieve the level of “absurdity or extreme feeling” she intended. Produced at the height of Minimalism and the Pop Art movement but belonging to neither, the piece was fabricated by her friend the artist Sol LeWitt, and her husband, Tom Doyle, who wrapped the wood stretcher with bed sheets and attached the cord-covered steel tubing. Sealed with acrylic, the object is subtly shaded from pale to dark ash gray. It is an ironic sculpture about painting, privileging the medium’s marginal features: the frame and its hanging device, represented by the cord that protrudes awkwardly into the gallery. The title might be understood as a humorous instruction for the sculpture’s display but also acts on a more psychological level. Collapsing the space between the viewer and the artwork, <em>Hang Up</em> creates a sense of disorientation and toys with our ability to discern a clear demarcation between painting and sculpture.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"182.9 × 213.4 × 198.1 cm (72 × 84 × 78 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":198.1,"depth_in":78,"width_cm":213.4,"width_in":84,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on cloth over wood; acrylic on cord over steel tube","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gifts of Arthur Keating and Mr. and Mrs. Edward Morris","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Robert Pincus–Witten and Linda Shearer, Eva Hesse: A Memorial Exhibition, exh. cat.

In their partnership (formed in 1911 at the time of their marriage), Walter Burley Griffin was chief designer, while Marion Mahony, one of the nation’s first women to distinguish herself in architecture, contributed to design and produced the spectacular renderings for which the firm was noted. In this exquisite work, she delineated the pair’s major domestic work and the most important planning scheme of the Prairie School: the Iowa housing development Rock Crest–Rock Glen (begun in 1912). The vaguely Japanesque intertwining of single-family dwellings within the eighteen-acre site is a perfect encapsulation of the Prairie School’s emphasis on the harmonious integration of suburban domesticity and a tamed, almost pastoral, nature. Of the sixteen proposed houses, eight were built, four by the Griffins. Just as construction began, the couple won the international competition to plan Canberra, the new capital of Australia; the commission allowed them to bring their aesthetic to an international audience.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"59 × 201 cm (23 1/4 × 79 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":201,"width_in":79,"height_cm":59,"height_in":23.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Lithograph and gouache on green satin","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Marion Mahony Griffin through Eric Nicholls","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Van Zanten, David T., ed. 1970.

A pivotal figure of the German Expressionist movement, Kirchner first met Mueller, also a painter-printmaker, in 1910. Mueller then joined Die Brücke (The Bridge), the group Kirchner had helped found in 1905, which was instrumental in promoting Expressionism. The period between 1915 and 1919 marked Kirchner’s most concentrated and productive phase of work with portrait prints, which he made primarily as large-format woodcuts. In this depiction of Mueller, Kirchner used a spare, planar composition and broad areas of undifferentiated color to depict his subject’s sharp features. He painted on a single block with a brush and varying colors; thus, each print is unique. The cobalt-blue striated forms that emanate from the figure’s right and from the side of his head in this print are abstract representations of the painted bands that decorated Kirchner’s studio wall, against which Mueller posed. These bands, which Kirchner painted himself, exemplify his adoption of motifs and styles from Palauan art of the South Pacific and resonate with Mueller’s own fondness for African-inspired furniture and wall paintings. Indeed, his hieratic, frontal position may suggest his interest in Egyptian art.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/block: 27.3 × 54.6 cm (10 3/4 × 21 1/2 in.); Sheet: 30.2 × 55 cm (11 15/16 × 21 11/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":54.6,"width_in":21.4961,"height_cm":27.3,"height_in":10.7481,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/block"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":55,"width_in":21.6536,"height_cm":30.2,"height_in":11.8898,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Color woodcut with charcoal on cream wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Dr. Eugene A.

Inspired by the metaphysical qualities of de Chirico’s work, as well as the biomorphic forms of Jean Arp, Max Ernst, and Joan Miró, Tanguy quickly developed his own fantastic vocabulary of organic, amoeba-like shapes that populate mysterious, dreamlike settings.</p>\n<p>Tanguy painted this primordial landscape on a hinged wooden screen. Little information exists about the circumstances of the work’s making, but the artist probably intended it for a patron’s home, since many Surrealists were interested in the decorative arts and produced folding screens, furniture, and other domestic objects.

His art is distinguished by energetic lines, dramatic movement, and subtle psychology. Here a taut precision characterizes the youth’s garment, and a carefully composed rhythm governs Mochi’s virtuoso treatment of the corkscrew curls. In contrast to the greater precision of the hair and drapery, the wistful expression of the youth, with his slightly parted lips, endows the sculpture with life. This work may have been conceived as a portrait, but it is more likely a biblical or mythological subject. The almost transcendent expression suggests that the sculpture may represent a religious figure, such as the youthful Saint John the Baptist.

A brilliant colorist and a master of expansive spatial effects, he pioneered a new pictorial language that was at once emphatically abstract and powerfully emotive. For Newman, the spiritual content of abstract art was of paramount importance. Although his works seem largely focused on the formal qualities of painting, he insisted that they possessed symbolic meaning. This meaning was never explicit, but he often alluded to it in the titles of his works, as with <em>The Beginning</em>. In the mid-1940s Newman became preoccupied with the Old Testament story of Creation and began selecting titles in reference to the book of Genesis. In this painting, the bands of paint that emerge from the base of the canvas interrupt a richly variegated field of color, a sort of primordial fog. The artist created these three stripes with the aid of masking tape, which he applied to the canvas as a guideline before adding the surrounding color. This work is an important precursor to Newman’s mature paintings, which are characterized by a single vertical band, or “zip,” that divides the composition.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"101.6 × 75.6 cm (40 × 29 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":75.6,"width_in":29.75,"height_cm":101.6,"height_in":40,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"None","credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mr. and Mrs. Carter H.

The ruins of the city lie beneath downtown Mexico City. Known as the <em>Stone of the Five Suns</em>, this monument draws connections between Aztec history and the cosmic scheme. The quadrangular block is carved with the hieroglyphic signs of five successive cosmic eras, called “suns” in the language of the Aztecs. These eras were mythic cycles of creation and destruction that began in the time of genesis and continued with the birth of humankind and the period of Aztec rule. From “4 Jaguar-sun” in the lower-right corner, the eras proceed counterclockwise through “4 Wind-sun,” “4 Rain-sun,” and “4 Water-sun.” The X carved in the center represents “4 Movement-sun,” the sign of the present era for the Aztecs. The year “11 Reed” in the square cartouche refers to 1503, the year of Motecuhzoma’s coronation, while the day listed above it—“1 Crocodile”—corresponds to July 15, when the ceremony probably occurred. On the underside, the hieroglyphic date “1 Rabbit” denotes the beginning of things in the distant mythological past. The sculpture thus legitimizes Motecuhzoma’s rule as part of the cycle of birth, death, and renewal and presents him as heir to the world in the present era of creation.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"55.9 × 66 × 22.9 cm (22 × 26 × 9 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":22.9,"depth_in":9,"width_cm":66,"width_in":26,"height_cm":55.9,"height_in":22,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Basalt","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Major Acquisitions Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"H.B.

For over forty years, this group of roughly fifty pictures remained unknown and inaccessible in the East German home of the friend in whose custody Feininger had left them. Only after a prolonged legal battle were all but three of the pictures finally returned to the artist's heirs in 1984 and exhibited as a group in 1985.<br>This picture reveals an artist of remarkable maturity and vision, despite the fact that Feininger had not turned seriously to painting until 1907. It was only then that improved financial circumstances allowed him to give up his successful career as a cartoonist. The setting for this painting is the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Its majestic viaduct became a frequent subject in the artist's drawings starting as early as 1908. His intense interest in architecture, which was to remain constant in Feininger's work, is apparent here not only in the use of the viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored block of houses in the middle ground. It may have been reinforced at this time by his interest in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34225\"> Robert Delaunay</a>'s work, in which architectural subjects likewise plays a primary role.<br>Feininger's early admiration for <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40610\"> Vincent van Gogh</a> seems evident in the heavily impastoed surface and in the use of highly saturated colors, especially yellow, which in the row of houses is beautifully modulated by touches of pink, green, and orange. Also reminiscent of van Gogh are the animated, billowing contours of the houses' rooftops, which in turn echo the sweeping movement of the clouds. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger deployed a motley crew of grotesque and vaguely sinister characters, some of whom recall Feininger's earlier cartoons. With their vividly colored costumes, these figures create a striking counterpoint to the dominant yellow of the background. But the ultimate impression is one of dissonance between the grandeur and beauty of the town's architecture and the bombastic artificiality of its inhabitants.</p>\n<p>—Entry,  Margherita Andreotti, <em>Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies</em>, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 144-145.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"104.8 × 95.9 cm (41 1/4 × 37 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":95.9,"width_in":37.75,"height_cm":104.8,"height_in":41.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":1990,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":65.2688,"color":{"h":46,"l":48,"s":64,"percentage":0.035536057593978806,"population":278},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 392","gallery_id":23990,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":null,"department_id":null,"artist_id":34470,"artist_title":"Lyonel Feininger","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[34470],"artist_titles":["Lyonel Feininger"],"category_ids":[],"category_titles":[],"term_titles":["painting","carnivals","Modernism","modern and contemporary art","figures (representations)","costumes","music","musical instruments","clowns","yellow (color)","houses","structures","buildings","bridges","city scenes","towns","celebrations","Joseph Winterbotham Collection"],"style_id":"TM-5981","style_title":"Modernism","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-5981"],"style_titles":["Modernism"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-12902","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12283","TM-12659","TM-8906","TM-8832","TM-9137","TM-11842","TM-12493","TM-12668","TM-12296","TM-12467","TM-12608","TM-12677","TM-12612","TM-14413"],"subject_ids":["TM-12902","TM-12283","TM-12659","TM-8906","TM-8832","TM-9137","TM-11842","TM-12493","TM-12668","TM-12296","TM-12467","TM-12608","TM-12677","TM-12612","TM-14413"],"subject_titles":["carnivals","figures (representations)","costumes","music","musical instruments","clowns","yellow (color)","houses","structures","buildings","bridges","city scenes","towns","celebrations","Joseph Winterbotham Collection"],"material_id":null,"alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":[],"material_titles":[],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"63f330b7-1015-96a5-ffa9-f1dbceb354d4","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Carnival in Arcueil","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1990.119"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Carnival in Arcueil"],"weight":8607,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-05T10:43:43-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:17:55-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:42:09-06:00"}

His largest painting up to that date, the work exemplifies the Dutch-born innovator’s style, with its expressive brushwork and distinctive organization of space into sliding planes with open contours. According to the artist, the point of departure for the painting was an image of women working in a rice field in <em>Bitter Rice</em>, a 1949 Neorealist film by Italian director Giuseppe de Santis. The mobile structure of hooked calligraphic lines defines anatomical parts—bird and fish shapes, human noses, eyes, teeth, necks, and jaws—that seem to dance across the painted surface, revealing the particular tension between abstraction and figuration that is inherent in de Kooning’s work. The original white pigment has yellowed over the years, diluting somewhat the flashes of red, blue, yellow, and pink that punctuate the composition.

Distinguished by his official government cap, with its long streamers, the otherwise disheveled, bare-legged scholar bids farewell to his neighbors on the shore. Servants valiantly attempt to carry children and the family’s belongings—scrolls, furniture, and dishes—through the water. The scholar depicted here may represent Yang Pu, a character described in stories of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). According to folklore, Yang Pu initially declined, and then reluctantly accepted, his appointment to a government position in the capital city. Chinese law forbade civil officials from working in their native districts, and as a result, many were required to relocate to distant cities. Painters and poets frequently depicted the theme of farewell, or “noble parting,” exemplified by the story of Yang Pu. The twigs that protrude from the official caps of the men depicted here may allude to the ancient Chinese custom of presenting departing friends with small branches from a willow tree.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"52.7 × 231.1 cm (20 3/4 × 91 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":231.1,"width_in":91,"height_cm":52.7,"height_in":20.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Handscroll; ink and light color on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

His best work in this vein portrays solid middle-class citizens, much like himself, with a keen perceptiveness of both character and physical appearance. Throughout his career, Wright was preoccupied with the evocative effects of light, specifically those produced by a single light source such as a candle, and the resulting play of shadows. Influenced by the powerful chiaroscuro of the superb mezzotints of Thomas Frye, a contemporary printmaker, Wright produced a number of dramatically lit self-portraits in oil, charcoal, and black-and-white pastel during the mid-1760s. Depicting himself in nocturnal lighting, wearing an exotic black hat, the artist evoked a time-honored tradition in portraiture: the deeply pensive artist who confronts himself and the viewer with a quiet challenge. Wright later ventured into landscape and genre subjects, the most original of which are concerned with the exploration of light phenomena. Portrait commissions continued to be a reliable source of income throughout his career.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"42.5 × 29.5 cm (16 3/4 × 11 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":29.5,"width_in":11.6142,"height_cm":42.5,"height_in":16.7323,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Monochrome pastel (grisaille) on blue-gray laid paper","inscriptions":"Not signed","credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Benedict Nicholson, Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of Light, 2 vols.

His immersion in color and this new technique brought about a change in the artist’s approach to his subject matter as well. <em>Flower Clouds</em> is one of a number of pastels executed around 1905 that are dominated by spiritual overtones. Here a sailboat bears two figures, perhaps two saintly women, on a timeless journey through a fantastic, phosphorescent sea and sky. The dreamlike skiff may reflect Redon’s internal voyage, replacing the nocturnal turmoil of the earlier <em>Noirs</em> with a more hopeful vision. The luminous intensity of the pastels echoes the ardent spirituality of the theme.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"44.5 × 54.2 cm (17 9/16 × 21 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":54.2,"width_in":21.3386,"height_cm":44.5,"height_in":17.5197,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Pastel, with touches of stumping, incising, and brushwork, on blue-gray wove paper with multi-colored fibers altered to tan, perimeter mounted to cardboard","inscriptions":"Signed lower left, in black conté crayon: \"ODILON REDON\"","credit_line":"Through prior bequest of Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

Of the few pastels that Delacroix produced, this is the only group that can be related to a single painting. Inspired by an 1821 play by the English Romantic poet Lord Byron, the canvas dramatically depicts the last king of the Assyrians. Reclining on his bed moments before his own suicide, the king gazes passively at his wives, concubines, and livestock as they are slain by his order to prevent their slaughter by the enemy army that has just defeated them. In this expressive image of one of the concubines, Delacroix convincingly captured the horror of the moment. With a sure, sweeping line, he described the rhythmic, taut posture of a figure recoiling from a blow or the stab of a knife. Although this powerful figure is significantly truncated in the final painting, the pastel provides insight into Delacroix’s creative process, and its sensual drama is representative of the Romantic period.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"24.6 × 31.4 cm (9 11/16 × 12 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":31.4,"width_in":12.3623,"height_cm":24.6,"height_in":9.6851,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Black and red chalk, with pastel, heightened with white chalk, over wash, on tan wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior bequest of Mr. and Mrs. Martin A.

The scene depicts the emperor at age thirteen, three days after his accession. Seated on a gold throne placed on a carpeted platform, Akbar watches as his late father’s favorite is arrested for his insolent behavior toward the young emperor. The setting—a tented encampment pitched in a garden—is significant, for Akbar spent much of his reign on the move. Through his active campaigning and strong administrative skills, he greatly expanded the Mughal Empire, consolidating and securing it for his successors. In addition, he was a great patron of the arts, initiating a new style of painting and establishing a vast atelier and library.</p>\n<p>One of the new themes the emperor encouraged was the painting of historical manuscripts such as the <em>Akbarnama</em>. Commissioned in 1589, it was written by court historian and biographer Abu’l Fazl between 1590 and 1596. Simultaneously, a workshop of about fifty artists illustrated the text. Basawan, the designer of this painting, whose signature appears in the lower margin in red, was one of the studio’s leading painters. He was particularly skilled in portraiture and is known to have painted the faces of the young emperor and the two other figures in front of him: the regent Bairam Khan, who is standing, and the disgraced Shah Abu’l-Ma'ali, who crouches in a red robe. He also painted some of the nearby scenery, which attracted his interest; each painting was collaborative work and could take up to a month to complete.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image: 32 × 19.3 cm (12 5/8 × 7 9/16 in.); Outermost border: 33 × 19.6 cm (13 × 7 11/16 in.); Page: 34.4 × 20 cm (13 1/2 × 7 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":19.3,"width_in":7.5625,"height_cm":32,"height_in":12.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":19.6,"width_in":7.6875,"height_cm":33,"height_in":13,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Outermost border"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":20,"width_in":7.875,"height_cm":34.4,"height_in":13.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Page"}],"medium_display":"Opaque watercolor and gold on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Lucy Maud Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":8,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":64.0371,"color":{"h":41,"l":52,"s":90,"percentage":0.033571247684167034,"population":403},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Arts of Asia","department_id":"PC-7","artist_id":100581,"artist_title":"Basawan","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[100581],"artist_titles":["Basawan"],"category_ids":["PC-7","PC-837"],"category_titles":["Arts of Asia","Arts of Asia 100"],"term_titles":["miniature painting","paper (fiber product)","painting (image making)","men","gold","watercolor","horses","animals","guns","swords","birds","painting","asian art","Islamic (culture or style)"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":["TM-13482"],"style_ids":["TM-13482"],"style_titles":["Islamic (culture or style)"],"classification_id":"TM-340","classification_title":"miniature painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-26"],"classification_ids":["TM-340","TM-9","TM-26"],"classification_titles":["miniature painting","painting","asian art"],"subject_id":"TM-10121","alt_subject_ids":["TM-8804","TM-12218","TM-12303","TM-8884","TM-11211"],"subject_ids":["TM-10121","TM-8804","TM-12218","TM-12303","TM-8884","TM-11211"],"subject_titles":["men","horses","animals","guns","swords","birds"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":["TM-2452","TM-2403"],"material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-2452","TM-2403"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)","gold","watercolor"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Arts of Asia 100"],"image_id":"c3c4fa77-ae12-1e5e-cc8a-0bde4f1be2ca","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"The Young Emperor Akbar Arrests the Insolent Shah Abu’l-Maali, page from a manuscript of the Akbarnama","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1919.898"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Young Emperor Akbar Arrests the Insolent Shah Abu’l-Maali, page from a manuscript of the Akbarnama"],"weight":5230,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-05-31T14:42:35-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:18:56-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:42:17-06:00"}

The upper portion of the scene consists of a platform on which are gathered the shah, or Persian king, who appears next to the column on the right; five kneeling courtiers; and various attendants serving fruit and wine. The king is identified in the artist’s signature at the upper left as Shah ‘Abbas II, who died in 1666, but it is possible that the undated painting was executed after his death. The ruler’s status is emphasized by his golden halo and by the opulent gold and jeweled vessels placed before him. The lower portion shows a roundup of horses who bear the trident-like royal brand on their flanks; they move in a spiral that coils counterclockwise from the upper right. The scene bursts with energy and looks chaotic—a brawl is taking place at the lower left—but the courtiers and handlers seem to be getting control of the animals. The figures on the platform, meanwhile, pay no attention to the commotion below.</p>\n<p>The painting represents a new journalistic, even anecdotal approach to Persian painting introduced in the second half of the seventeenth century. The viewer gets the sense that the work may record a specific moment in daily life at court and that it was observed firsthand. Figures no longer conform to stock types but are highly individualized by facial features and dress. Standing just to the right of center in the upper part of the roundup scene is a man wearing a gold, fur-lined, armless jacket.

Originally, the work was related to a 1909 commission by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin, who wanted two large canvases to decorate the staircase of his Moscow home. Matisse proposed three pastoral images, though Shchukin decided to purchase only two works, <em>Dance II</em> and <em>Music</em> (both State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg).</p>\n<p>Four years later, Matisse returned to this canvas, the rejected third image, altering the idyllic scene and changing the pastel palette to reflect his new interest in Cubism. He reordered the composition, making the figures more columnar, with faceless, ovoid heads. Over the next years, Matisse transformed the background into four vertical bands and turned the formerly blue river into a thick black vertical band. With its restricted palette and severely abstracted forms, <em>Bathers by a River</em> is far removed from <em>Dance II</em> and <em>Music</em>, which convey a graceful lyricism. The sobriety and hint of danger in <em>Bathers by a River</em> may in part reflect the artist’s concerns during the terrible, war-torn period during which he completed it.</p>\n","short_description":"Matisse worked on this painting for years, increasingly restricting the palette and abstracting the forms. His faceless figures are composed of simplified shapes; one steps into a thick, black band that seems to represent the river, while a white, snakelike form slithers near another bather’s feet. The artist considered this painting one of his most pivotal in the evolution of his mature style.","dimensions":"260 × 392 cm (102 1/2 × 154 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":392,"width_in":154.1875,"height_cm":260,"height_in":102.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.l.: \"Henri-Matisse\"","credit_line":"Charles H. and Mary F.

Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as “bird-and-flower,” whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou’s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue.</p>\n<p>Yao Shou accompanied the magpie—as he did its companion images—with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou:</p>\n<p><q>In the bright moonlight, why does the<br>magpie circle three times before<br>alighting?<br>During sunny days, it sings on the green<br>branches.<br>I also practice divination to find the place<br>where the magpie often roosts.<br>It stays on the rooftop of the old master’s<br>house, and the stars arrive late.</q></p>\n<p>The title and artist’s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. “Pillars of the Country” refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China’s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar —  all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past.</p>\n<p>As documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95), China’s most passionate imperial collector.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Handscroll; ink and color on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Buckingham Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Suzuki, Kei comp. “Comprehensive Illustrated Catalog of Chinese Paintings (Chûgoku kaiga sôgô zuroku)”, vol. 1: American and Canadian Collections.

Around 1909 Léger began to paint in a Cubist style, although his compositions in this mode are more colorful and curvilinear than works by Braque and Picasso of the same period, with their angular forms and subdued tones. An artist with far-ranging interests and talents, Léger later became a designer for theater, opera, and ballet, as well as a book illustrator, filmmaker, muralist, ceramist, and teacher.</p>\n<p>Typically, Léger would develop a major composition by preparing studies in a variety of media. <em>The Railway Crossing</em> is an oil study for <em>The Level Crossing</em> (1919; private collection, Basel, Switzerland). When he took up this subject in 1919, he made a number of drawings and oil sketches, including the present work. Like many of his contemporaries, Léger was fascinated by the machine age. He maintained that machines and industrial objects were as important to his art as figures. References to such elements pervade <em>The Railway Crossing</em>. In the midst of a complex scaffolding of cylinders and beams, an arrow appears on a brightly outlined signboard. A network of solid volumes and flat forms seems to circulate within the shallow space, just as pistons move within a motor. The precise definition of his forms and the brilliance of his palette express Léger’s belief that the machine, along with the age it created, was one of the triumphs of modern civilization.</p>\n<p>— Entry, <em>Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 2013, p. 118.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"54.1 × 65.7 cm (21 5/16 × 25 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":65.7,"width_in":25.875,"height_cm":54.1,"height_in":21.3125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"F.

Picabia was amused by two fellow passengers—a Polish dancer named Stacia Napierskowska and a Dominican priest who could not resist the temptation of watching her rehearse with her troupe. While the tumultuous shapes in this work suggest fragments of bodies and nautical architecture, the depiction of specific forms is less important than the effective expression of contrast and rocking motion, which evokes the sensations of dance and a ship moving through rolling seas. On the top right of the canvas, Picabia painted the word <em>Edtaonisl</em>—an acronym made by alternating the letters of the French words <em>étoile</em> (star) and <em>dans[e]</em> (dance), a process analogous to the artist’s shattering and recombining of forms. He subtitled the work <em>Ecclesiastic</em>, hinting at the juxtaposition of the spiritual and the sensual.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"300.4 × 300.7 cm (118 × 118 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":300.7,"width_in":118,"height_cm":300.4,"height_in":118,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed and dated, l.r.: \"Picabia 1913\"; inscribed, u.r.: “EDTAONISL”","credit_line":"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Armand Bartos","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Salon d’Automne, 11e Exposition, exh. cat.

This effort, known as the Counter-Reformation, recognized the educational and inspirational value of visual images and required artists to work in a style that favored clarity and dramatic fervor.</p>\n<p>In 1627 Francisco de Zurbarán, then living and working in the provincial Spanish town of Llerena, painted this <em>Crucifixion</em> for the monastery of San Pablo el Real in prosperous Seville. In the dimly lit sacristy where it was installed, the image of Christ awed the faithful. A later commentator noted that it appeared to be a sculpture rather than a painting. Zurbarán envisioned the crucified Christ suspended outside of time and place. Conforming to Counter-Reformation dictates, the artist depicted the event occurring not in a crowd but in isolation. Emerging from a dark background, the austere figure has been both idealized in its quiet, graceful beauty and elegant rendering and humanized by the individualized face and insistent realism. Strong light picks out anatomical detail, the delicate folds of the white loincloth, and a curled scrap of paper at the base of the cross on which the artist’s name and the date of the painting are inscribed.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"290.3 × 165.5 cm (114 5/16 × 65 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":165.5,"width_in":65.1875,"height_cm":290.3,"height_in":114.3125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed and dated on a scrap of paper painted at the foot of the cross","credit_line":"Robert A.

Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>. But what was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years.</p>\n","short_description":"Van Gogh’s face is as well known as his art—in fact, it is inseparable from it. The artist painted more than 35 self-portraits over his lifetime. This one was created in Paris under the influence of Seurat and pointillism. The intense dabs of paint and color, anchored by his eyes, create a turbulent energy, giving the viewer a deep sense of the artist’s presence.","dimensions":"41 × 32.5 cm (16 1/8 × 12 13/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":32.5,"width_in":12.8125,"height_cm":41,"height_in":16.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on artist's board, mounted on cradled panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>Faille, de la F345 1970</p>","publication_history":"J[acob]-B[aart] de la Faille, L'œuvre de Vincent van Gogh, Catalogue raisonné vol. 1-2 (Paris: G.

Corot almost never exhibited these studies of the human form, preferring instead to publicize the idyllic landscapes that were his specialty. To emphasize the private nature of <em>Interrupted Reading</em>, Corot enclosed his model within the protective environment of the artist’s studio. The mood of the painting is introspective and somewhat melancholic, the very essence of the Romantic sensibility. The muse-like image of a woman reading a book was a popular one in nineteenth-century art, but Corot chose to show his model pausing, looking up from this activity. Having spent a number of years in Italy and being a lover of everything Italian, the artist often furnished his models with Italianate costumes such as the one worn here. Whereas Corot’s subject matter is traditional, his technique is not. With direct and bold brushwork, he explored the human form as a construction of masses that support and balance one another. This broad handling is complemented by the artist’s obvious delight in detail—the ribbon in the model’s hair, the delicate earrings, the deep folds in the skirt. Here he combined a profound sense of formal structure with the dreamy softness and intimacy that characterize his most famous landscapes.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"92.5 × 65.1 cm (36 5/16 × 25 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":65.1,"width_in":25.625,"height_cm":92.5,"height_in":36.3125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas mounted on board","inscriptions":"Inscribed middle left: Corot.","credit_line":"Potter Palmer Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>Robaut 1431</p>","publication_history":"Alfred Robaut, L’oeuvre de Corot: catalogue raisonné et illustré, précédé de l’histoire de Corot et de ses oeuvres vol. 3 (Paris, 1905), no. 1431 (ill.)

Although they were depicted in the center of a circus ring, the sisters actually posed in costume in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s studio, enabling him to paint them in daylight. Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad.</p>\n","short_description":"The two girls in this painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir are Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg, acrobats who performed in the famed Cirque Fernando in Paris.

Pollock emphasized the expressive power of the artist’s gestures, materials, and tools, often applying paint with sticks, trowels, and palette knives instead of brushes. He also challenged the concept of easel painting by working on canvases placed either on the floor or fixed to a wall. With no apparent beginning or end, top or bottom, his paintings imply an extension of his art beyond the edges of the canvas, engulfing the viewer. Among the last great purely abstract paintings Pollock made before his untimely death in 1956, <em>Greyed Rainbow</em> is a quintessential example of action painting. The paint application ranges from thick chunks squeezed directly from a tube to thin, meandering lines poured from a container with a small hole or squirted from a baster. The work is predominantly black, white, gray, and silver; in the bottom third of the canvas, however, Pollock thinly concealed orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The title of the work presumably refers to these grayed sections of hidden color.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Unframed: 182.9 × 244.2 cm (72 1/16 × 96 3/16 in.); 182.9 × 244.2 cm (72 × 96 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":244.2,"width_in":96.1418,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72.0079,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Unframed"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":244.2,"width_in":96.125,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on linen","inscriptions":"Signed and dated: recto: \"Jackson Pollock 53\" (bottom right in black paint); verso: \"Jackson Pollock / 53\" (upper left in black paint)","credit_line":"Gift of Society for Contemporary American Art","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Robert Coates, “Review,” “New Yorker” (February 20, 1954), pp. 81–82.\n\nJames Fitzsimmons, “Art,” “Arts and Architecture” 71, 3 (March 1954), pp. 7, 30.\n\nThomas B.

Ivan Albright considered <em>The Door</em> to be his most important picture, and he worked for ten years to achieve its mesmerizing effect. He spent weeks collecting props for the painting: a marred Victorian door found in a junkyard, a faded wax funeral wreath, and a tombstone for the doorsill. Once he arranged these objects, Albright completed an elaborate charcoal underdrawing that he then covered with the intricate and obsessively painted detail that characterizes most of his work. He would often finish no more than a quarter of a square inch a day. A wrinkled, aging woman’s hand rests on the carved doorway, a faded blue handkerchief clenched between the fingers. The poignant placement of the hand, near but not touching the doorknob, only underscores the sense of remorse and mourning implied by the painting. With its profound themes of mortality and the passage of time, <em>The Door</em> is a modern memento mori that encourages a consideration of the brevity of human existence.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"246.4 × 91.4 cm (97 × 36 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":91.4,"width_in":36,"height_cm":246.4,"height_in":97,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed lower right: Ivan Le Lorraine Albright","credit_line":"Mary and Leigh Block Charitable Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Manny Farber, “Artists for Victory: Metropolitan Museum of Art Opens Great Exhibition for American Artists,” <em>Magazine of Art</em> 35, 8 (Dec. 1942): 276–77 (ill.).\n\nA.

These coveted plumes were taken from macaws, parrots, toucans, cotingas, and tanagers from the tropical forests of South America. Because they were transported across the treacherous peaks of the Andes, the feathers were extremely rare and valuable and would only have been available to the most elite members of pre-Hispanic society. Thus, the feathered tunic—with its stylized felines, birds, and fish—would have been a sumptuous emblem of power, wealth, and prestige. Like many other pre-Hispanic textiles, it was buried with its owner in a subterranean tomb on the southern coast of Peru. The dark and arid conditions in these tombs protected the tunic, thereby allowing its vibrant colors and bold motifs to endure.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"85.1 × 86 cm (33 1/2 × 33 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":86,"width_in":33.875,"height_cm":85.1,"height_in":33.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Cotton, plain weave; embellished with feathers knotted and attached with cotton in overcast stitches","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

Although the temple was built by the powerful king Jayavarman VII (1181-1218), a follower of Buddhism, some scholars believe that the statues illustrate the Hindu myth of the Churning of the Ocean of Milk. Both the gods and the demons on the opposite side of the causeway hold the giant serpent Vasuki in their arms in a tug of war to obtain <em>amrita</em>, the nectar of immortality. Another interpretation is that the statues represent guardian figures, with the symbolic protection of the snake, separating and delimiting the world of the sacred from that of the profane. The gods and demons both frown protectively as they guard the entrance to the temple, but they are distinguishable by the shape of their eyes and their headgear.  The gods, as demonstrated by this head, have almond eyes, a diadem, long earrings, and a conical chignon decorated with five rows of lotus leaves. The demons have round eyes, furrowed brows, long hair, and fantastical headdresses. An architectural masterpiece, Angkor Thom illustrates the syncretic relationship of the Hindu and Buddhist belief systems of Southeast Asia.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"87 × 45.7 × 40.6 cm (34 1/4 × 18 × 16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":40.6,"depth_in":16,"width_cm":45.7,"width_in":18,"height_cm":87,"height_in":34.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Sandstone","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Samuel M.

In <em>Still Life with Geranium</em>, he transformed a simple still life into a populated Arcadian landscape painting, rendered in the brilliant color, thick paint, and rapid brushwork characteristic of the group of painters known as the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). Matisse was recognized by critics as the leader of this group.</p>\n<p>This composition is one of contrasts—the pale palette and light brushwork in the upper half of the picture are juxtaposed with the darker colored, heavily painted lower half; the firmly planted pose of the female figure is contraposed with the almost-ﬂeeing figure of the male; and the red vegetables grown near Paris are set near ceramic objects from exotic, faraway places. One of many still-life paintings in which Matisse incorporated his own figurative sculptures, here the artist challenged his viewers’ expectations by rendering his modeled figures with minimal color and simple lines. Probably represented as plaster casts, these figures would later be made in bronze editions by the artist; versions of <em>Woman Leaning on Her Hands</em> (on the right of the geranium) and <em>Thorn Extractor</em> (on the left) are also in the collection of the Art Institute.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"100.3 × 81.5 cm (39 1/2 × 32 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":81.5,"width_in":32.125,"height_cm":100.3,"height_in":39.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed lower left: Henri-Matisse","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Paul Cassirer, X.

Made possible by a Guggenheim Foundation grant (the first awarded to a foreigner), this photographic odyssey resulted in a landmark book, <em>Les Américains</em>, published in France in 1958. The brilliant technical “wrongness” of Frank’s gritty, rough, and graceless images represented a new and highly influential expressionistic approach to photographic observation. Meant to be viewed as a series, Frank’s photographs are filled with such Americana as luncheonettes and jukeboxes, tailfins and motels, and the American flag. Dominating this depiction of the nation’s annual birthday party, which Frank made before embarking on his trip around the United States, the star-spangled banner hardly waves bravely or freely. Instead it hangs down over a Fourth of July picnic, sheer and patched, like the bars of a prison. As the Beat writer Jack Kerouac noted in his introduction to the controversial 1959 American edition of Frank’s book: “With that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film.” Frank subsequently turned to filmmaking and returned to still photography upon his move to Nova Scotia in 1969.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 33.9 × 22.5 cm (13 3/8 × 8 7/8 in.); Mount: 45.9 × 30.5 cm (18 1/8 × 12 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":22.5,"width_in":8.8583,"height_cm":33.9,"height_in":13.3465,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":30.5,"width_in":12.0079,"height_cm":45.9,"height_in":18.0709,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Mount"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print, from \"The Americans\" (1955/56)","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; verso unchecked","credit_line":"Photography Gallery Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Greenough, Sarah. 1994. “Robert Frank: Moving Out.” Essays by Philip Brookman, Martin Gasser, W.

After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand design, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern. The vigor of El Greco’s broad brushstrokes proclaims the conﬁdent achievement of this early work, as does this artist’s large signature in Greek, painted as though affixed to the surface of the picture at the lower right.</p>\n","short_description":"This painting was the central element of an altarpiece that was El Greco’s ﬁrst major Spanish commission and large public work.

Beginning in the ninth century, the worship of luohan and their depiction in art evolved primarily in the context of the Chan (Zen), or “meditation,” sect of Buddhism. This head was created in the delicate technique of hollow dry lacquer. The artisan first soaked layers of coarse cloth in lacquer (a thick sap tapped from a sumac tree) and applied these to a clay core formed over an armature of wood or other material. After allowing the work to dry, he applied a thick layer of lacquer paste to create the basic shape of the sculpture and a thinner coat into which he carefully modeled the eyes, high cheekbones, and other facial features. After removing the core and supporting armature, he set colored beads behind the eyes to represent irises and pupils. Finally, he painted the surface and perhaps applied gilding. Although these surface finishes have disintegrated over the centuries, the sensitively executed facial features preserve the insightful expression of the luohan.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"28.6 × 18 × 20 cm (11 1/4 × 7 1/16 × 7 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":20,"depth_in":7.875,"width_cm":18,"width_in":7.0625,"height_cm":28.6,"height_in":11.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Hollow dry lacquer","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Orientals","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Charles Fabens Kelley, “A Dried Lacquer Head of the T’ang Dynasty,” Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 23, 1 (January 1929), pp. 2-3\n\nOtto Fischer, Chinesische Plastik (Munchen: R.

The work is literally a testament to the piety of Pedro López de Ayala, a major figure in the political and cultural life of late medieval Spain. He was a courtier, soldier, and diplomat in the service of the kings of Castile, eventually serving as chancellor; he also wrote poetry, a treatise on hunting, and important chronicles of his era.</p>\n<p>Ayala expected his altarpiece to be a perpetual plea for his eternal salvation and that of his family. Indeed, for more than five hundred years, it decorated the family’s funerary chapel in their fortified palace in northern Spain. Ayala was careful to declare his donation of the altarpiece in honor of Christ and the Virgin Mary through the inscription that runs across the bottom margin; the images of himself and his wife, Leonora de Guzman, kneeling in prayer with their son and daughter-in-law at either end of the lower register; and their coats of arms — two wolves and two cauldrons —  alternating around the frames.</p>\n<p>The massive altarpiece must have been constructed and painted inside the small chapel. To accomplish this, Ayala called upon local artists, who created a series of scenes that tell the stories of the life of Christ and the Virgin and center on images of the Crucifixion and of an empty throne that probably once framed a statue of the Virgin and Child. These scenes are not projections of convincing pictorial space. Rather, with their plain backgrounds and framing arcades, they hark back to earlier architectural decoration and manuscript illumination. The altarpiece was clearly intended to impress through its monumental scale, its narrative clarity, and its costly materials, which include gold and silver leaf and glazes of rare and expensive ultramarine blue.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Retable Image: 232.1 × 649 cm (91 3/8 × 255 1/2 in.); Frontal Image: 86 × 266.9 cm (33 7/8 × 105 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":649,"width_in":255.5,"height_cm":232.1,"height_in":91.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Retable Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":266.9,"width_in":105.0625,"height_cm":86,"height_in":33.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Frontal Image"}],"medium_display":"Tempera and gold on panel","inscriptions":"Inscribed:\n:COMO:FUE:FALLADO:IXU:XPO:ENL:TENPLO:Q:ENSENA[U?]ALA:LEY:.COMO:IHU:XPO:TORNA:EL:AGUA:BINO:.COMO:IHS:XPO:REÇUSÇITO:.AL:TERCER:DIA:.EL:CRUÇIFI:XO:.COMO:IHS:XPO:.SUBIO:ALOS:ÇIELOS:.COMO:\nUINO[:]EL[:]ESP[I]RITU:SANTO:EN:SANTA:MARIA:E:EN:LOS:APOSTOLES:.

The artist aligned herself with Abstract Expressionists such as Mark Rothko, admiring their investigations of chromatic color schemes, allover compositions, and emotional content. In the 1960s, she developed a vocabulary of grids and graphs that prompted critics to compare her work to the radical simplicity and intellectualism of Minimal and Conceptual artists. Indeed, <em>Untitled #12</em>—a crisply stated graphite grid on a light-gray ground—seems at first to be an exemplar of Minimalism. But close observation reveals a flickering light and extremely refined touch that suggest a spiritual, rather than purely aesthetic, stance. Martin’s deeply solitary nature led her to achieve a quiet, tenuous balance between the material and the immaterial, the sensual and the austere.</p>\n<p>The artist stopped painting in 1969; she moved from New York City to a remote, rural area of New Mexico. In 1975, she began to paint again. Although Martin maintained that her art was not abstracted from nature —“Work like mine,” she remarked, “describes the subtle emotions that are beyond words, like music”—the paintings she produced in the Southwest embody the quiet landscapes, even light, and desert tonalities of her surroundings.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"182.9 × 182.9 cm (72 × 72 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":182.9,"width_in":72,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"India ink, graphite, and gesso on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Frank G.

Depicted here is the actor Bandō Mitsugorō portraying the character Ishii Genzō at the peak dramatic moment of the play <em>The Iris Sōga of the Bunroku Era (Hanaayame Bunroku Sōga)</em>. With a look of intense fury, Genzō draws his sword to aid his two brothers-in-law in avenging their father’s murder. The play is based on an event that occurred in 1701 that disrupted the civil order of the Tokugawa shogunate and scandalized the population of Edo. Commentary on contemporary issues was discouraged by the Japanese government, however, so the play was disguised as a literary recounting of a famous twelfth-century act of filial revenge that occurred in the Sōga family.

Although his subject matter has become less commonplace, he continues to “borrow” from the public domain. <em>Perilous Night</em>, for instance, owes its title to a pivotal and expressive piece of music written by the American composer John Cage (1912–1992) in 1945. Both score and cover sheet are rendered on the right-hand side of the drawing with Johns’s characteristically fluid handling of ink. On the sheet’s left side is a freehand rendition—abstracted, reversed, and turned ninety degrees—of a single, terror-stricken soldier from the Resurrection panel of Matthias Grünewald’s sixteenth-century masterwork the Isenheim Altarpiece (Unterlinden Museum, Colmar). Between the soldier and the musical score is a black imprint of Johns’s right arm, evidence perhaps of the creative power that can merge two disparate images into a cogent statement. The overcome soldier witnessing the Resurrection of Christ and a piece of music marking a key transition in a composer’s career both point to “perilous nights” that can change the course of a human life. Characteristically, Johns also explored the same subject in different media. This somberly colored drawing derives from a painting of the same name (1982; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC).</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"85.3 × 109.8 cm (33 5/8 × 43 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":109.8,"width_in":43.2284,"height_cm":85.3,"height_in":33.5827,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Higgins ink on frosted mylar","inscriptions":"Signed, dated, and inscribed, recto, lower right, in ink: \"J Johns / Stony Point, N.Y. / August 1982\"","credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mary and Leigh Block; Harold L.

Consisting of a tall, narrow, wood vessel and a dramatically arched top flap that seems poised to slam down upon it, <em>Lever #1</em> exemplifies the artist’s ongoing exploration of the relationship between interior space, form, and volume. The sculpture suggests an array of possible associations, including a deep-hulled boat, a coffin, or sexual themes. It also reflects some of the most celebrated methods of avant-garde art, notably Constructivism and assemblage. While the sculpture alludes to recognizable forms and subjects, Puryear intended for it to remain independent of specific interpretations. The surface is alive with the remnants of glue, staples, and other marks of construction; these residual effects serve as a reminder that, above all else, the work is about the process of making sculpture.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"429.3 × 340.4 × 45 cm (169 × 134 × 17 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":45,"depth_in":17.75,"width_cm":340.4,"width_in":134,"height_cm":429.3,"height_in":169,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Red cedar, cypress, poplar, and ash","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"A.

He focused on this subject only during certain phases of his career, and very few of the resulting studies, which he used to prepare biblical or mythological representations, survive today. This strong form is a late work, and one of only four extant drawings of the female nude attributed to Rembrandt with certainty. Unlike the almost scientific realism of his earlier nudes, his late studies are less detailed and more painterly. He attained a maximum of expression with a minimum of means. Rendered with a swift treatment by brush and the blunt reed pen favored by the artist in his late years, this ample figure projects a forceful presence. Her face is generalized, and her feelings are suggested through her contemplative pose. Her simple shape and external immobility seem to increase the viewer’s sense of her inner vitality. In <em>Seated Female Nude</em>, Rembrandt’s penstrokes and brushwork are integrated with the utmost lightness and perfection; the pen stresses structural features, while the brush provides a transparent, atmospheric tone linking figure and space.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Primary/secondary supports: 21.2 × 17.5 cm (8 3/8 × 6 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":17.5,"width_in":6.8898,"height_cm":21.2,"height_in":8.3465,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Primary/secondary supports"}],"medium_display":"Pen and brown ink and brush and brown wash, with subtractive highlights (scraping) and touches of opaque white watercolor corrections, on ivory laid paper, laid down on cream laid card","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Société de Reproduction des Dessins de Maîtres (Paris, 1913), vol.

He began the first of twenty-seven <em>Bird</em> sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations <em>Maiastra</em>, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute’s <em>Golden Bird</em>, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Brâncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree’s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.</p>\n","short_description":"Trained in both folk and academic traditions, Constantin Brancusi broke with the currents of his time by combining different materials for single works and simplifying form in his search for his subjects’ essence.

Remarkable for their sculptural naturalism, these stirrup-spout bottles were molded without the aid of a potter’s wheel and painted in earth tones. Moche potters represented everything about their world, from domestic scenes to architecture, ritual events and royal personages, and animals and plants. This portrait vessel portrays individual characteristics—the furrowed brow and full, slightly protruding upper lip—as well as general features recognizable among Peruvian Indians today. With his commanding expression and proud bearing, the depicted ruler conveys an indelible sense of the power of Moche leaders. His elite status is further indicated by his fine headdress, decorated with the geometric motifs of Moche textiles, and by his elongated ear ornaments and the traces of facial paint on his forehead and cheeks. Vessels such as this were placed in burials as funerary offerings, but before they accompanied an individual to the grave, they may also have been sent as emblems of royal authority from a center of power to neighboring districts along with gifts of textiles and other ceremonial presents.</p>\n","short_description":"Ceramic portrait vessels produced by artists of the Moche culture are the only discernible examples of portraiture, in a Euro-American sense, from the ancient Andes. Vessels like this one were often placed in burials as funerary offerings. They may also have been sent as emblems of royal authority, or even emissaries, to other elite individuals in nearby settlements.","dimensions":"35.6 × 24.1 cm (14 × 9 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":24.1,"width_in":9.5,"height_cm":35.6,"height_in":14,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ceramic and pigment","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

Eight double-sided mirrors radiate like spokes from the center of a chalk pile located on the gallery floor. As they slice through the pile, the mirrors separate the chalk into almost identical wedge-shaped compartments. The double reflection in each compartment preserves the illusion of the whole pile, making the mirror dividers appear nearly invisible. This work is also one of Smithson’s <em>Site/Nonsite</em> pieces. The artist referred to the first stage of the work as a “Site Incarnation,” which he created for a particular outdoor location: in this case, a chalk quarry in Oxted, York, England. After setting up and photographing the Site piece, the artist then dismantled it. The materials were subsequently reinstalled in the Nonsite location, the seminal 1969 exhibition <em>When Attitude Becomes Form</em> at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. This process purposefully blurred the boundaries between art and its environment, within and without gallery walls.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Approximately: Diam.: 304.8 cm (120 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":0,"height_in":0,"diameter_cm":304.8,"diameter_in":120,"clarification":"Approximately"}],"medium_display":"Sixteen mirrors and chalk","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Morris","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Robert Hobbs, “Robert Smithson: Sculpture” (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 5, 168-69, fig. 49, pp. 239, 257.\n\nEugenie Tsai, “Robert Smithson,” Arts Magazine 62, 4 (December 1987), p. 94.\n\nMadeleine Grynsztejn and Dave Hickey, About Place: Recent Art of the Americas, exh. cat.

This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of Fragonard’s genius—in a series of fantasy portraits, he used references to earlier artists to enliven his own characterizations of his patrons and artistic friends. Here the identity of the sitter is unknown; however, the half-length format, the rapid, virtuoso handling of the paint, and the use of seventeenth-century costume link this work to the fantasy portraits. In this instance, Fragonard took as his starting point a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti, then in a leading Parisian collection; in other related portraits, the French painter was inspired by the bravura style of the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. Two paintings from this series bear inscriptions stating that they were painted in one hour. Whether or not this is literally true, the direct, personal quality that results from Fragonard’s command of the medium makes this series particularly appealing to a modern sensibility.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"80.3 × 64.7 cm (31 5/8 × 25 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":64.7,"width_in":25.5,"height_cm":80.3,"height_in":31.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mary and Leigh Block in honor of John Maxon","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Baron Roger Portalis, Honoré Fragonard: Sa Vie et son oeuvre, vol. 2, Paris 1889, pp. 277, 286. \n\nGeorges Wildenstein, The Paintings of Fragonard: Complete Edition, London, 1960, pp. 14, 256, no. 247, pl. opp. p. 42.\n\nCharles Sterling in Portrait of a Man (The Warrior), Jean Honoré Fragonard, exh. cat., Williamstown, Mass., Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 1964, n. pag., fig. 17.\n\nDaniel Wildenstein and Gabriele Mandel, L’opera completa di Honoré Fragonard, Classici dell’arte 62, Milan, 1972, p. 97, no. 264 (ill.).\n\n“New Accession,” Apollo 106 (October 1977), p. 311, fig. 6.\n\n The Art Institute of Chicago, 100 Masterpieces, Chicago, 1978, pp. 25, 77. no, 37.\n\nDenys Sutton in Fragonard, exh. cat., Tokyo, The National Museum of Western Art, 1980, n. pag.\n\nJacques Vilain in French Painting: The Revolutionary Decades, 1760–1830, exh. cat., Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 1980, p. 87, under no. 38.\n\nMary Sheriff Jones, “The Portraits de Fantasie [sic] of J.–H.

Although his large output included landscapes, genre paintings, and the occasional still life, he focused on biblical and historical paintings and on portraits. As an extension of these interests, the artist studied the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of costume and rich, subtle lighting. Rembrandt collected costumes to transform his models into characters. Here, the gold chain and steel gorget suggest an honored military career, while the plumed beret evokes an earlier time. The broad black mass of the old man’s torso against a neutral background is a powerful foil for these trappings. The face is that of a real person, weathered and watchful, glowing with pride and humanity. The unidentified sitter, once thought to be the artist’s father, was a favorite model, appearing in many of the artist’s early works. The confident execution suggests that the young Rembrandt completed this picture about 1631, when he had left his native Leiden to pursue a career in the metropolis of Amsterdam; perhaps he wished to use this work to demonstrate his skill in a genre that combined history painting and portraiture.</p>\n","short_description":"In his character studies, Rembrandt explored the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of rich, subtle lighting and costumes, which the artist collected to transform his models.

Drawing inspiration from New York–based Pop Art, Paschke often culled his subjects from newspapers, tabloid magazines, and television, producing work that taps into the movement’s kitsch aesthetic. Although his paintings depict representational imagery, they play heavily upon expressionist distortion, particularly in his use of psychedelic, inharmonious colors. Paschke’s love of urban subcultures and his interest in the underbelly of American society translated into a penchant for sensational subject matter. In his early works, Paschke painted circus freaks and other marginal figures, in marked contrast to, for example, Andy Warhol’s overriding concern with mainstream celebrity. <em>Minnie</em>, which depicts a now-anonymous individual silhouetted against a background of emanating light, is typical of his artistic production from this period. With her theatrical costume, elaborate hairdo, and bizarre makeup, this larger-than-life figure becomes a grotesque. By painting a flamboyant, overtly sexualized underworld character in a peculiar mixture of electric hues, Paschke added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"128 × 96.5 cm (50 3/8 × 38 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":96.5,"width_in":38,"height_cm":128,"height_in":50.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on linen","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Robert A.

In 1894 he turned his skill and energy to sculpture. This vigorous portrayal of a cowboy taming a wild horse was the artist’s first effort in bronze, and with an illustrator’s eye for drama, he captured the single most illuminating moment of the event. Although the horse and rider struggle against each other, they are pulled together at the instant of utmost exertion. As the bronco rears up, back arched and splayed tail snapping, the cowboy leans forward, his whip suspended in midair as he clutches the reins and horse’s mane. This minutely rendered, spirited, and technically remarkable depiction of life in the West became one of the most popular American bronzes of the early twentieth century. The Art Institute’s version is one of nearly seventy made at the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company of New York using the French sand-casting method.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"60 × 54.7 × 34.5 cm (23 5/8 × 21 9/16 × 13 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":34.5,"depth_in":13.5827,"width_cm":54.7,"width_in":21.5355,"height_cm":60,"height_in":23.6221,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Bronze with brown patina","inscriptions":"Right side of base: \"Copyright by / Frederic Remington 1895\"\nLeft top of base: \"Frederic Remington\" with \"55\" in F of signature\nRear top of base: \"The Henry-Bonnard Bronze Co.: Founders N.Y. 1899\"\nMark on bottom center: \"no. 55\"","credit_line":"George F.

This woven piece is distinguished by its large size, imposing composition, and brilliant, unfaded shades of red, green, blue, brown, and yellow. The figure’s commanding frontality, solemn expression, and animated side glance, together with the composition’s bold lines and vivid colors, relate this fragment to hauntingly realistic portrait icons. Also suggestive of icons is the three-dimensional appearance of the warrior’s face and legs and the columns—an effect much easier to achieve in painting than in weaving. Woven of indigenous materials, this hanging is composed of linen warps and wool and linen wefts that create an uncut pile against a plain-weave foundation, a fabric surface less common in Byzantine textiles than the tapestry weave.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"136.5 × 88.3 cm (53 3/4 × 34 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":88.3,"width_in":34.75,"height_cm":136.5,"height_in":53.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Linen and wool, plain weave with weft uncut pile and embroidered linen pile formed by variations of back and stem stitches","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Grace R.

Poetic mélanges of found objects and materials, his deeply personal and elusive work (which also includes many collages on paper) combines the enthusiasms of his childhood—butterflies, marbles, seashells, sky charts, stamps—with adult fascinations such as ballerinas, empty cages, and movie stars. Cornell’s boxes often prompt a dizzying series of associations; in <em>Untitled (Butterfly Habitat)</em>, these include Christmas decorations, collector’s cabinets for specimens, microscopes, natural history displays, sailor’s boxes, and windows. Some of these references are contradictory, reinforcing the work’s ambiguity. Ideas linked to flight, voyages, and the exotic are countered by the rigid and symmetrical organization of the display. The butterflies are not, however, pinned as they would be on a specimen board. Each pane of paint-spattered glass encloses a small compartment with white wood walls in which a cutout of a paper butterfly is suspended with string, allowing for some movement as the box is handled.</p>\n","short_description":"For approximately 30 years, Joseph Cornell worked in relative obscurity in the basement of his home in Queens, New York, creating wondrous miniature worlds within his boxed constructions.

The result was his remarkable publication <em>Paris at Night</em> (first published in France in 1933), which depicts not only such well-known spots as the Arc de Triomphe, but also dark streets and alleys with just enough light to reveal a flower-shop window, a pissoir, a show at the Folies-Bergère, or the details of wet paving bricks. This image is from a 1932 series taken around Les Halles, in which Brassaï recorded women he called the “Venuses of the Crossroads,” or prostitutes standing at their posts. With an aura of mystery, Brassaï captured one of these ladies of the evening as she stood on the puddled street corner, smiling into the shadows.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 23.3 × 17.3 cm (9 3/16 × 6 13/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":17.3,"width_in":6.8111,"height_cm":23.3,"height_in":9.1733,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; stamped verso, lower right, in purple: \"PHOTO BRASSAI / COPYRIGHT BY / GYULA HALASZ / 74, RUE DE LA GLACIÈRE / PARIS (13e) [\"e\" in superscript]\" ; inscribed verso, lower center, in graphite: \"21 [encircled] / RMG 282.31\"","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Mrs. Leigh B.

He was largely self-taught, and as a teacher at Chicago’s Institute of Design (1946–61), he continued to learn by assigning photographic problems to students and then solving them himself. Influenced by both the classicism of Ansel Adams and the experimentalism of László Moholy-Nagy, Callahan fused formal precision and exploration with personal subjectivity. He photographed a wide range of subjects—female pedestrians lost in thought on Chicago’s streets; architectural facades; his wife, Eleanor; and weeds and grasses in snow. <em>Chicago</em>, one of his best-known pictures, shows trees covered in snow along Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive. Although Callahan captured all of the detail available in the bark and snow in his negative, he purposely printed this image in high contrast to emphasize the black-and-white forms of the trees against the stark backdrop. With a graphic sensibility typical of the Institute of Design, Callahan reminds the viewer that a photograph is first and foremost an arrangement of tones and shapes on a piece of paper.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 19.2 × 24.2 cm (7 9/16 × 9 9/16 in.); Mount: 20.2 × 25.3 cm (8 × 10 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":24.2,"width_in":9.5276,"height_cm":19.2,"height_in":7.5591,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":25.3,"width_in":9.9607,"height_cm":20.2,"height_in":7.9528,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Mount"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":"Signed recto, on mount, lower right, below image, in graphite: \"Harry Callahan\"; inscribed verso, on mount, upper left, sideways, blue pencil: \"Box 1#\"; signed verso, center, in blue ink: \"Harry Callahan\"","credit_line":"The Mary and Leigh Block Endowment Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Greenough, Sarah, Joel Snyder, David Travis and Colin Westerbeck. 1989. “On the Art of Fixing a Shadow: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Photography.” Exh. cat.

Traveling through much of the United States, to England and continental Europe, and (three different times) to Brazil, he produced work ranging from pristine views of East Coast salt marshes and lush tropical landscapes to pictures of exotic hummingbirds and orchids. At the age of sixty-four, Heade settled in Saint Augustine, Florida. There he began painting detailed arrangements of native flowers, including the Cherokee rose, orange blossom, and magnolia. Stretched out like an odalisque on blue velvet cloth, the curvaceous magnolia was meticulously rendered in pale, subtle hues and illuminated by a light so sharp that the image evokes the hyperintensity of a dream. The warm, steamy atmosphere is almost palpable, as is the blossom’s heady, pungent scent. The Art Institute’s <em>Magnolias</em> is one of a number of compositions by the artist featuring this dramatic yet delicate white flower.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"38.6 × 61.8 cm (15 1/4 × 24 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":61.8,"width_in":24.375,"height_cm":38.6,"height_in":15.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, lower right: \"M.

Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O’Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O’Keeffe wrote:</p>\n<p>&quot;I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide—it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold—I worked in the garage and it had no heat—Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 1970 <em>Sky above Clouds IV</em> was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O’Keeffe’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum’s permanent collection.</p>\n<p>The special relationship between O’Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O’Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.</p>\n","short_description":"Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O’Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work is the final painting in a series the artist made based on her experiences as an airplane passenger.

Eye problems arising from lead-based oil paint poisoning were the partial cause of this dramatic change. Of his thirteen extant pastel self-portraits, the most famous are versions of the example seen here, with the casually dressed, aging artist in his studio. A virtuoso colorist, the septuagenarian here revealed a joyously free stroke and palette. Nonetheless, the construction of the figure is solid and rigorous, adding to his powerful presence. This composition was created at the same time as a portrait of the artist’s wife for the 1775 Salon (Musée du Louvre, Paris). A year later, Chardin—with greater daring—replicated the pair. These later portraits were separated for almost two hundred years, until they were reunited in the collection of the Art Institute.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"45.7 × 37.4 cm (18 × 14 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":37.4,"width_in":14.7245,"height_cm":45.7,"height_in":17.9922,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Pastel on blue laid paper, mounted on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Clarence Buckingham Collection and the Harold Joachim Memorial Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Lady E.

His work since then has often reflected, with wit and incision, the sun-washed flatness of the Southern California environment. Perhaps the most iconic example from a group of double portraits of friends and associates from the 1960s, this large painting depicts contemporary-art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman in the sculpture garden of their Los Angeles home. As Hockney said, “The portrait wasn’t just in the faces, it was in the whole setting.” As relentlessly stiff and still as the objects surrounding them, the couple stands apart, his stance echoed in the totem pole to the right, hers in the figurative sculpture behind her. Mrs. Weisman’s distorted mouth also mirrors that of the totem pole. Mr. Weisman’s shadow falls possessively over the abstract sculpture at his feet. His hand is clenched so tightly it seems as if he were squeezing paint out of his fist (Hockney deliberately left the drips). Brilliant, raking light flattens and abstracts the scene.

While executing a commission from Empress Josephine of France for a full-length statue of Paris (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Canova carved this bust for his friend Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, a French Neoclassical theorist and critic who greatly inﬂuenced the sculptor’s artistic ideals. It depicts the moment in Greek mythology when the shepherd Paris, called upon by Zeus to judge who was the most beautiful among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, turns to gaze at the three goddesses. Canova exploited the subject to create an ideal head, balancing the geometry of pure forms with the sensuousness of Paris’s expression. Upon receipt of the gift, Quatremère stated: “There is in [the bust] a mixture of the heroic and the voluptuous, the noble and the amorous. I do not believe that in any other work you have ever combined such life, softness, and chaste purity.” Documents indicate that Canova made four full-length marble statues and at least seven busts of Paris, a clear indication of the sculpture’s popularity.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"69.9 × 30.8 × 28 cm (27 1/2 × 12 1/8 × 11 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":28,"depth_in":11,"width_cm":30.8,"width_in":12.125,"height_cm":69.9,"height_in":27.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Marble","inscriptions":"Inscribed: Ant(o)nio Quatremere/Amico Optimo/Antonius Canova/Dono Dedit/F.

As director of the School of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Mies stressed the importance of bold, clean designs based on structure, materials, and function. Stanley Tigerman was among the many architects schooled in the Miesian tradition, and he based much of his work in the 1960s and 1970s on the designs of the famed architect. Tigerman’s restless curiosity and iconoclastic spirit, however, led him to question the authority and durability of Mies’s program. <em>The Titanic</em> is a conceptual project that was meant to provoke architects to contend with the Mies legacy, challenging them to choose sides: move beyond Mies or remain cemented to the past. The photocollage pitches Mies’s Crown Hall (1950–56), one of the architect’s most iconic and revered designs, into the deep. Tigerman mailed copies of the work to members of the architectural establishment, including an offer of a one-way ticket on the <em>Titanic</em>. Although the title of the work portends the end of Mies’s dominance, Tigerman acknowledged that many would see the building as rising back to the surface, ever triumphant.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Approx: 28 × 35.7 cm (11 × 14 1/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":35.7,"width_in":14.0625,"height_cm":28,"height_in":11,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Approx"}],"medium_display":"Photocollage, gelatin silver print, cardboard","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Stanley Tigerman","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Tigerman, Stanley. 1982.

It is one of six bureaus that can be attributed to the celebrated cabinetmaker John Townsend on the basis of similar construction and design features in labeled pieces by the maker. For example, the carved shells have central C-scrolls featuring petals and crosshatched baskets, all motifs that are indicative of Townsend’s work. In addition, the top is integrated into the case by cove-and-bead molding, with smaller cavetto molding underneath. The blocking of the upper drawer continues through the side drawers and into the graceful double scroll of the bracket feet, creating an unbroken visual plane that unifies the design elements.</p>\n<p>Kept in bedchambers, bureau tables most likely functioned as dressing tables. They were particularly popular among the Quaker citizens of Newport, who appreciated the wide array of storage possibilities they offered. According to oral tradition, Samuel Fowler originally owned this bureau. A successful merchant, Fowler frequently conducted business with the Townsend family. In 1786 and 1787, John Townsend purchased hinges, nails, and sundries from Fowler. This relationship bolsters the argument that Fowler owned this bureau, since patronage loyalty resulting from familial, religious, and trading ties was typical in eighteenth-century Newport.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"86.6 × 93.4 × 58 cm (34 1/8 × 36 3/4 × 20 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":58,"depth_in":20,"width_cm":93.4,"width_in":36.75,"height_cm":86.6,"height_in":34.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Mahogany, chestnut, and tulip poplar","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Jamee J. and Marshall Field","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Judith A.

No female artist enjoyed greater success or exerted more influence on the art of her era than Rosalba, as she is known. The artist’s work in pastel divides itself into two categories: portraits and allegories. A shrewd judge of character, she enhanced but never obscured the actual appearance of the sitters in her portraits. In contrast, her allegorical types are often so generalized that they can seem repetitive, bland, and undistinguished. <em>A Young Lady with a Parrot</em> is an intriguing combination of both genres. The colorful parrot is a witty conceit that subtly transfers the provocative gesture of baring one’s breast from the young woman to a mischievous bird, whose beak pulls back the gauzy fabric that edges the sitter’s bodice. With its rich colorism and vaporous effects, <em>A Young Lady with a Parrot</em> is a mature work, exhibiting the assurance of Rosalba’s finest and most famous portraits. The pastel may depict a young Englishwoman, perhaps one of the daughters of Lord Manchester.

Motivated by the shoddy results of industrial mass production, the movement advocated the recognition of furniture and decorative arts as works of art. Here the celebrated English architect and designer Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott created an object that is both cleverly functional and aesthetically pleasing. When opened, the lid and doors of the strikingly decorated cabinet act as acoustical sounding boards. Revealed inside is the musical instrument itself, along with a profusion of exquisite handcrafted metalwork, including candleholders fixed to the sides of the case. The overall design, like the keyboard, is a study in contrasts of light and dark; the lower section’s alternating pattern echoes the piano’s keys. A Manxman is an inhabitant of the Isle of Man, and the term derives from Scott’s early residence there. This piano is one of a number executed around 1900 with John Broadwood and Sons of London, who made the musical movements.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"128.9 × 143.2 cm (50 3/4 × 56 3/8 in.); With top open: H.: 162.6 cm (64 in.); With one door open: W.: 212.4 cm (83 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":143.2,"width_in":56.375,"height_cm":128.9,"height_in":50.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":162.6,"height_in":64,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"With top open"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":212.4,"width_in":83.625,"height_cm":0,"height_in":0,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"With one door open"}],"medium_display":"Oak, ebony, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and copper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Robert Allerton, Mrs. Joseph Regenstein, Sr., Walter S.

She married the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1924, and the following year they moved into the Shelton, a recently completed skyscraper. O’Keeffe was fascinated by the soaring height of the building and emphasized its majesty in this painting by rendering it from the street below. In the glaring light of the emerging sun, the building becomes an abstracted series of rectangles arranged in the center of the composition. Yet the hard edges of the Shelton are softened by the numerous circular sunspots and wavy, flowing lines of smoke and steam, suggesting that despite her urban subject matter, O’Keeffe nevertheless sought to unify man-made and organic forms, just as she would in her southwestern paintings such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46327\"><em>Black Cross, New Mexico </em></a>.</p>\n","short_description":"In 1925, Georgia O'Keeffe moved to the 30th floor of the New York's Shelton Hotel, then the tallest hotel in the world.

Concerned with the general principles of urban planning, his radical designs were intended to improve universal living conditions by addressing basic needs, attending to physical comfort, and promoting social discourse. Drafting was a vital, theoretical part of Le Corbusier’s process. To promote his ideas about modern building techniques and social reform, he published his drawings in books and in his journal, <em>L’Esprit nouveau</em>, disseminating his views to a wide audience. Le Corbusier was a crusader for new technologies and materials, such as reinforced concrete and pillar foundations. These resources liberated architectural design, allowing for the creation of vast, open floor plans with unobstructed window walls. <em>Club de Centre Rural</em> alludes to Le Corbusier’s rational yet humane vision of urban life. This perspective sketch, which displays Le Corbusier’s trademark economy of line, depicts a large, airy space in which clusters of people congregate. The building is constructed of plain walls and slender supporting pillars, divided and fronted by walls of pure glass.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"16.2 × 21 cm (6 3/8 × 8 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":21,"width_in":8.25,"height_cm":16.2,"height_in":6.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ink on laid paper","inscriptions":"Initialed at bottom right, \"L-C\"","credit_line":"Architecture Society Fellows Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":"The Art Institute of Chicago, \"Past Forward: Architecture and Design Collection at the Art Institute,\" September 12, 2017 – January 21, 2018.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, \"The Modern Movement,\" cat. no. 51.","provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":25,"fiscal_year":1986,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris / FLC","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":18.0025,"color":{"h":37,"l":80,"s":48,"percentage":0.7983120987386016,"population":4408},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Architectural Drawing","artwork_type_id":34,"department_title":"Architecture and Design","department_id":"PC-5","artist_id":31814,"artist_title":"Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret)","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[31814],"artist_titles":["Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret)"],"category_ids":["PC-5","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Architecture and Design","Essentials"],"term_titles":["design sketch","ink","20th Century","architecture","drawing (image-making)","architectural drawing","architecture","paper (fiber product)","interiors","buildings","design sketch","diagrams","laid paper","columns","drawing","people","perspective","sketch","urban life"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-1097","classification_title":"design sketch","alt_classification_ids":["TM-126","TM-103"],"classification_ids":["TM-1097","TM-126","TM-103"],"classification_titles":["design sketch","architectural drawing","architecture"],"subject_id":"TM-12085","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12285","TM-12296","TM-12548","TM-12098","TM-11232","TM-13376","TM-8810","TM-13373","TM-14669","TM-10126"],"subject_ids":["TM-12085","TM-12285","TM-12296","TM-12548","TM-12098","TM-11232","TM-13376","TM-8810","TM-13373","TM-14669","TM-10126"],"subject_titles":["architecture","interiors","buildings","design sketch","diagrams","columns","drawing","people","perspective","sketch","urban life"],"material_id":"TM-2398","alt_material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-3070"],"material_ids":["TM-2398","TM-2982","TM-3070"],"material_titles":["ink","paper (fiber product)","laid paper"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3919"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"28513c3e-ef16-0101-568c-9e752b53ce8a","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Club de Centre Rural: Perspective Sketch","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1985.218"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Club de Centre Rural: Perspective Sketch"],"weight":948,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:19:07-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-10T11:27:09-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:43:37-06:00"}

His eye is of a dangerous fixedness; . . . [and] the instant his lips close, a visor of steel would scarcely look more impenetrable.” William Rush rendered a remarkably similar depiction of the general. Demonstrating a blend of naturalism, subtlety, and strength, Rush avoided grandiosity in this terra-cotta portrait bust of the fifty-two-year-old military hero, who, ten years later, would begin to serve the first of two consecutive terms as president of the United States. The artist’s only concession to idealization was the replacement of the general’s well-known stiff, wiry hair with the soft curls that signify noble qualities in Neoclassical sculpture. Since there is no documentation that Jackson formally posed for Rush, the artist, a prominent resident of Philadelphia, may have observed the general during his three-day visit to the city in 1819. This sculpture achieved critical and commercial success, with one reviewer ranking it as “Rush’s masterpiece.” Hoping to benefit from Jackson’s popularity, Rush followed the European custom of producing plaster replicas of the bust.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"50.5 × 47.9 × 22.2 cm (19 7/8 × 18 7/8 × 8 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":22.2,"depth_in":8.75,"width_cm":47.9,"width_in":18.875,"height_cm":50.5,"height_in":19.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Terracotta","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Jamee J. and Marshall Field, the Brooks and Hope B.

In a perfect match of medium and message, Castiglione, the Genoese artist credited with inventing the technique, used this new method to portray the central act of Genesis: the creation of man. He produced this electrifying image by subtracting the design from the inked surface of a copperplate with a blunt instrument, such as a stick or paintbrush handle, and then printing directly on a sheet of paper. Broad, angular strokes of white depict God emerging from a cloud, while thin, fluid lines extract the languid body of Adam from velvety blackness. Castiglione’s monotypes employ both this dark-ground technique, which naturally lends itself to dramatic and mysterious imagery, and the light-ground manner, in which the design is drawn in ink directly on a clean plate. Both processes yield only one fine impression. It was not until the nineteenth century that such versatile artists as Edgar Degas explored the monotype’s full potential.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"30.3 × 20.3 cm (11 15/16 × 8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":20.3,"width_in":7.9922,"height_cm":30.3,"height_in":11.9292,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Monotype in black ink on ivory laid paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of an anonymous donor; purchased with funds provided by Dr. William D. and Sara R.

Here the painted roundels featuring flowers and insects at top left and right of the cabinet emulate Japanese lacquer, while the floral inlay across the facade is reminiscent of patterns found in Japanese screen paintings and textiles. Japanese family crests inspired the bands of inlay across the tops of the doors and  above the side compartments, and Japanesque plum blossoms were carved in the arched spandrels on either side of the facade. Nevertheless, the overall form of the cabinet is Western, and the piece also includes such non-Japanesque elements as Egyptian-Revival paw feet.

Louis Sullivan’s foremost student, Wright continued his teacher’s search for an indigenous American architecture. Like Sullivan, Wright drew inspiration from nature and natural forms, and both men were pioneers of the Prairie School of architecture, characterized by low-slung, horizontal lines and rambling, open spaces that reflect the gently rolling landscape of the Midwest. Odes to the middle-class American family at the turn of the century, Wright’s residences are organic, designed not only to adapt to a family’s changing structure but also to contain the sense of a unified and harmonious whole. Every detail of the Coonley complex, like all of Wright’s projects, bore his personal imprint, down to the creation and placement of the furniture and the design of this window. Referencing such Americana as the flag and colored balloons, Wright explored the use of glass both as a transparent screen uniting exterior and interior and as a decorative element, the colors and design of which anticipate the later abstractions of Piet Mondrian.</p>\n","short_description":"This colorful window is from the Avery Coonley Playhouse, a small structure Frank Lloyd Wright designed as an addition to the Coonley family's suburban Chicago estate, which he previously completed in 1908.

The vessel bears the mark <em>CK</em>, standing for Cornelius Kierstede, a third-generation New York silversmith of Dutch descent. Kierstede opened a shop around 1698 in New York, where he worked, off and on, until moving to New Haven, Connecticut, in the early 1720s. Like the Van Cortlandt family, who commissioned this cup and whose coat of arms it bears, and the Stuyvesant family, whose descendants owned the object until the Art Institute acquired it, the majority of Kierstede’s patrons were wealthy Dutch colonists. This cup is one of four nearly identical pieces made during the same period by Kierstede and two other well-known New York silversmiths.

Using language as his medium, Weiner set out to question the conventional relationship between artist and viewer and to redefine standard systems of artistic display and distribution. In 1968 he issued a statement of intent, outlining the three conditions in which his works could exist: they could be built by him; fabricated by someone else; or not constructed at all. His works have the potential for being realized in countless ways and contexts; they may be shown outdoors as a public project, published in a book, printed on a matchbook cover, or simply spoken. He is best known, however, for written phrases presented on gallery or museum walls, typically in stenciled or vinyl lettering. Weiner felt the permanence and integrity of a linguistic construction, presented as a title in the form of a simple descriptive phrase on the wall, was less vulnerable to change over time than an actual sculpture. This work—which describes a physical act of displacement as a metaphor for representation—and its title are one and the same.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Dimensions vary with installation","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Language + materials referred to","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Lawrence Weiner","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":28.7309,"color":{"h":153,"l":44,"s":62,"percentage":0.003799343979939463,"population":18},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":33089,"artist_title":"Lawrence Weiner","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[33089],"artist_titles":["Lawrence Weiner"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials"],"term_titles":["installation","writing (processes)","20th Century","installations","modern and contemporary art","script","green (color)","English","languages","painting"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-1152","classification_title":"installation","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155","TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-1152","TM-155","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["installation","modern and contemporary art","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12572","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12579","TM-11849","TM-12578","TM-12488"],"subject_ids":["TM-12572","TM-12579","TM-11849","TM-12578","TM-12488"],"subject_titles":["installations","script","green (color)","English","languages"],"material_id":null,"alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":[],"material_titles":[],"technique_id":"TM-3985","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3985"],"technique_titles":["writing (processes)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"3ed898c9-f372-e4b7-7523-1e4cefd11819","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"TAKEN FROM HERE TO WHERE IT CAME FROM AND TAKEN TO A PLACE AND USED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT CAN ONLY REMAIN AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT WAS WHERE IT CAME FROM","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1982.402"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["TAKEN FROM HERE TO WHERE IT CAME FROM AND TAKEN TO A PLACE AND USED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT CAN ONLY REMAIN AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT WAS WHERE IT CAME FROM"],"weight":5709,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2021-12-02T12:58:39-06:00","updated_at":"2023-04-10T15:12:49-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:43:48-06:00"}

Like their English counterparts in the Arts and Crafts movement, the Secessionists initially supported the credo that art is for everyone and worked to create beautiful, simple objects for everyday use. A manifestation of this philosophy was the Wiener Werkstätte, or Vienna Workshop, of which Hoffmann was a founder and Czeschka a member. Produced by the Werkstätte’s specialist craftsmen, this clock embodies the unexpected dichotomy that arose within the workshop: its early reformist ideals resulted in progressive, even avant-garde, products that appealed primarily to a privileged, sophisticated clientele. Hoffmann’s design consists of simple, architectonic forms emphasized through the bold use of stark white-painted maple and an inlaid checkered pattern. In contrast to the case’s austere rectilinearity, Czeschka designed a luxurious, hand-wrought scheme for its dial and door. The door is fashioned from hand-embossed gilt brass inset with cut-glass prisms. Its richly patterned surface decoration depicts a stylized tree of life motif.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"179.5 × 46.5 × 30.5 cm (70 5/8 × 18 1/4 × 12 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":30.5,"depth_in":12,"width_cm":46.5,"width_in":18.25,"height_cm":179.5,"height_in":70.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Painted maple, ebony, mahogany, gilt brass, glass, silver-plated copper, patinated bronze, and clockworks","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Laura Matthews, and Mary Waller Langhorne endowments","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Lynn Springer Roberts, \"A Wiener Werkstätte Collaboration,\" Museum Studies, Vol. II, No, 2 (Spring 1985): 84-101.\n\nDAPA and Lynn Springer Roberts, \"DAPA Interview: Lynn Springer Roberts,\" The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts.

Deeply impressed by the ancient and Renaissance art of that city, he began painting monumental figures inspired by antiquity. His new classical style was influenced by the finely modeled odalisques of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and the late, oddly proportioned female nudes of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. <em>Mother and Child</em> was also inspired by Picasso’s own life. Just three years earlier he had married Russian dancer Olga Khokhlova, and in 1921 their son Paolo was born. Between 1921 and 1923 he produced at least twelve works on the subject of mothers and children, returning to a theme that he had explored during his Blue Period. But whereas those figures are frail and anguished, his classical-period figures, with their sculptural modeling and solidity, are majestic in proportion and feeling. Here an infant sits on the mother’s lap and reaches up to touch her. The woman, dressed in a Grecian gown, gazes intently at her child. Behind them stretches a simplified background of sand, water, and sky. Picasso’s treatment of the pair is not sentimental, but the relationship expresses a serenity and stability that characterized his own life at this time.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"142.9 × 172.7 cm (56 1/4 × 68 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":172.7,"width_in":68,"height_cm":142.9,"height_in":56.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"signed and dated l.r.: \"Picasso / 21\"","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Maymar Corporation, Mrs. Maurice L.

From 1909 until Braque was mobilized for World War I, they worked in creative dialogue, breaking down and reformulating the representation of objects and their structure. In doing so, they pioneered one of the most radical artistic revolutions of the twentieth century, Cubism. <em>Little Harbor in Normandy</em> is the first fully realized example of Braque’s early Cubist style. He described the English Channel coast in severe geometries and a sober palette, reduced in range and intensity to pale shades of color. His compressed treatment of space and use of a shifting perspective seems to propel the two sailboats forward to the front edges of the picture. To further energize the scene, the artist added a fringe of whitecaps to the sea and dashes of clouds across the sky. His repetitive, striated modeling of form, inspired by his study of the art of Paul Cézanne, increased the rigid tension of this canvas. Documentation suggests that <em>Little Harbor in Normandy</em> was exhibited in Paris in March 1909 at the Salon des Indépendants, making this painting the first major Cubist work to be shown in such a prominent venue.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"81.1 × 80.5 cm (32 × 31 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80.5,"width_in":31.75,"height_cm":81.1,"height_in":32,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"none","credit_line":"Samuel A.

This simplicity is complicated by the weight Tawney has given to the upper half of the circle, in which the warps are made of paper and fabric coated in thick blue paint. Here Tawney, known for her pioneering exposure of the warp (vertical thread element), provided a variant on that theme: she wove the circle with slits that open at regular half-inch intervals, emphasizing a third dimension, a device she utilized in many of her weavings. Trained in sculpture at the Institute of Design in Chicago and an alumna of the School of the Art Institute, Tawney’s exploration of weaving as a sculptural enterprise fits well within her body of work, which also includes laminated boxes and collages as well as constructions composed of such materials as eggshells and chairs.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"397.6 × 369 cm (156 1/2 × 145 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":369,"width_in":145.25,"height_cm":397.6,"height_in":156.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Linen, warp-faced weft-ribbed plain weave with discontinuous wefts; 18th/19th century manuscript pages cut into strips, attached, and painted with Liquitex acrylic paint; braided, knotted, and cut warp fringe","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"H.

Instead, his depictions of demigods in naturalistic settings interpret themes from Classical mythology in an idiosyncratic, often sensual manner. <em>In the Sea</em>, part of a series of paintings of mythological subjects, displays an unsettling, earthy realism. Mermaids and tritons frolic in the water with a lusty energy and abandon verging on coarseness. Occupying the center of the composition is a harpplaying triton. Three mermaids have attached themselves to his huge frame as if it were a raft; the one near his shoulder seems to thrust herself upon him. The work’s sense of boisterousness is tempered by the ominously shaped reﬂection of the triton and mermaids in the sea and by the oddness of the large-eared heads that emerge from the water at the right. In addition to imaginative, bizarre interpretations of the Classical world, Böcklin painted mysterious landscapes punctuated by an occasional lone figure. These haunting later works made him an important contributor to the international Symbolist movement. They also appealed to some Surrealist artists, particularly <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40490/giorgio-de-chirico\">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, who declared, “Each of [Böcklin’s] works is a shock.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"86.5 × 115 cm (34 3/8 × 45 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":115,"width_in":45.75,"height_cm":86.5,"height_in":34.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Heinrich Alfred Schmid, Arnold Böcklin: Eine Auswahl der hervorragendsten Werke des Künstlers in Photogravüre (Munich, 1897), vol.

Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created primarily through costume, hair, makeup, and lighting. In 1981 she began a series of large color photographs that mimic the horizontal format of a magazine centerfold. Critiques of these glossy spreads, Sherman’s representations are fraught with anxiety, vulnerability, and longing. In <em>Untitled #88</em>, she depicted herself as a young, disheveled blonde girl; her fragility and isolation are underscored by her huddled body language and pensive stare. An imposing darkness surrounds her, except for the warm glow from what is most likely a fire, the only source of light in the picture. While the girl’s specific situation remains ambiguous, the photograph illustrates that, for Sherman, gender roles are performative.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"61 × 121.9 cm (24 × 48 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":121.9,"width_in":48,"height_cm":61,"height_in":24,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Chromogenic print; artist's proof number one of one","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gerald S.

The artist’s French audience would have been receptive to his choice of jewel-like colors to describe the shimmering, gold-braided vest and billowing robes of the central figures.

Kahnweiler opened an art gallery in Paris in 1907 and in 1908 began representing Pablo Picasso, whom he introduced to Georges Braque. Kahnweiler was a great champion of the artists’ revolutionary experiment with Cubism and purchased the majority of their paintings between 1908 and 1915. He also wrote an important book, <em>The Rise of Cubism</em>, in 1920, which offered a theoretical framework for the movement.</p>\n<p>Kahnweiler sat as many as thirty times for this portrait. No longer seeking to create the illusion of true appearances, Picasso broke down and recombined the forms he saw. He described Kahnweiler with a network of shimmering, semitransparent surfaces that merge with the atmosphere around him. Forms are fractured into various planes and faceted shapes and presented from several points of view. Despite the portrait’s highly abstract character, however, Picasso added attributes to direct the eye and focus the mind: a wave of hair, the knot of a tie, a watch chain.

He developed this theme in all the media in which he worked, including transfer lithography, oil, pastel, and watercolor. The artist usually provided garments for his models to wear, often classical gossamer gowns with high waists and crossed bodices paired with brightly colored kerchiefs. His models needed a certain degree of strength and agility, as he sometimes asked them to dance about his studio until he found a suitable pose. In <em>Green and Blue: The Dancer</em>, Whistler employed thin watercolor washes to distill the graceful movements of his lissome young model. The brown paper on which he painted lends opacity to the washes, thereby adding subtle weight to the thin veils of fabric draping the figure.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"27.5 × 18.3 cm (10 7/8 × 7 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":18.3,"width_in":7.2048,"height_cm":27.5,"height_in":10.8268,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Watercolor and opaque watercolor over traces of black chalk on brown wove paper laid down on card","inscriptions":"Inscribed, verso, lower right, in black ink: \"8\"","credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Dr. William D.

Calm, stately, and full-bodied, the <em>bosatsu</em> is seated in a frontal, meditative pose; his gracefully held hands, raised midair, make a gesture of assurance. Buddhism, which originated in India with the teachings of the Buddha Sakyamuni, or Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563-c. 483 B.C.), was named the official religion of Japan at the beginning of the eighth century by the Emperor Shomu (701-56). This small, finely crafted lacquer figure is the only Buddhist sculpture outside Japan that is firmly attributed to the influential sculpture workshop of Todai-ji, the largest and most prestigious of the great state-sponsored Buddhist temples built during the Nara period. This sculpture represents a dramatic shift in Japanese sculptural tradition—a move away from the expensive, time-consuming technique of using lacquer (a resin extracted from the sap of a tree) over a temporary clay core that, once removed, left a sculpture that was completely hollow except for perhaps a wood bracing system. Here a sculpted wood core is overlaid with lacquer-soaked cloth. The innovative sculptors at the Nara temple modeled the wet and pliable surface of the cloth to create fine details such as facial features and jewelry. Finally the sculpture was gilt; traces of gold remain on the bodhisattva's face and chest.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"61 × 43.2 × 32.3 cm (24 × 17 × 12 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":32.3,"depth_in":12.75,"width_cm":43.2,"width_in":17,"height_cm":61,"height_in":24,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Wood core, dry lacquer, traces of gold leaf","inscriptions":"Nara period","credit_line":"Kate S.

This samovar, or Russian teakettle, beautifully illustrates the adroit mixture of taut lines and curvilinear motifs that characterizes Van de Velde’s mature Art Nouveau style. The sinuous organic lines of its base twist and snake around upright brackets and pick up again in the braided band motif of the teak handle. The kettle itself is simple in form, unornamented, and, with a prominent hinge on the spout cover, appears to be more engineered than crafted. This example was made from silvered brass and teak in accord with Van de Velde’s philosophy that art should be accessible and affordable to a broad public (though other examples were made of more costly silver). The kettle was designed at the Weimar School of Applied Arts, where Van de Velde became director in 1904. That school later became the Bauhaus, the bastion of modern design.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"37.9 × 28.5 × 23.5 cm (14 7/8 × 11 1/4 × 9 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":23.5,"depth_in":9.25,"width_cm":28.5,"width_in":11.25,"height_cm":37.9,"height_in":14.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Silvered brass and teak","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Historical Design Collection; Mr. and Mrs. F.

In his quest for underlying structure and composition, he recognized that the artist is not bound to represent real objects in real space. Thus, <em>The Basket of Apples</em> contains one of his signature tilted tables, an impossible rectangle with no right angles. On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds. The heavy modeling, solid brushstrokes, and glowing colors give the composition a density and dynamism that a more realistic still life could never possess. This painting, one of Cézanne’s rare signed works, was part of an important exhibition urged on the artist by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Since Cézanne had spent the majority of his career painting in isolation in his native Provence, this was the first opportunity in nearly twenty years for the public to see the work of the artist who is now hailed as the father of modern painting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"65 × 80 cm (25 7/16 × 31 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80,"width_in":31.5,"height_cm":65,"height_in":25.4375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower left:  P.

Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. <em>The Child’s Bath</em> is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.</p>\n","short_description":"Known for her sensitive yet unsentimental scenes of women and children, Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to exhibit with the original French Impressionist group. In <em>The Child’s Bath</em>, one of her masterworks, she used cropped forms, bold patterns and outlines, and a flattened perspective, all of which she derived from her study of Japanese woodblock prints.<","dimensions":"100.3 × 66.1 cm (39 1/2 × 26 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":66.1,"width_in":26,"height_cm":100.3,"height_in":39.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed lower left:  \"Mary Cassatt\"","credit_line":"Robert A.

Wealthy travelers making the grand tour of Europe—considered an essential part of an education for upper-class men—provided an important market for such views. In this case, however, the patron was not a foreigner passing through Venice, but John Strange, who lived in the city on the lagoon as the British resident, or representative.</p>\n<p>This view of the garden of a private house in Venice was highly unusual for Guardi. On the right is the rear facade of the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo; the front faces the Grand Canal. The artist’s main subject here is the palace’s formal garden, a luxury in Venice’s crowded urban environment. Elegant couples stroll through the garden’s geometric parterres. Guardi’s attention to the play of light further animates the scene—a shadow cast by an unseen building in the foreground divides the composition and contrasts with the bright light reflected off the facade of the residence and the distant, shimmering lagoon on the left.</p>\n<p>These observations of light and place probably reflect the aesthetic interests of Strange, who commissioned the painting from Guardi as one of a set of four remarkably original views. Two of the four paintings show Strange’s own villa on the mainland. What connection Strange may have had to the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo is unclear.</p>\n","short_description":"This painting by Francesco Guardi, an 18th-century landscape painter renowned for his inventive city views, depicts a luxurious Venetian green space. Elegant couples stroll, while a ballgame takes place in the distance and a single gondola slides across the lagoon.

Born in Pennsylvania, the artist’s interpretation of cotton fields drew upon a visit to South Carolina with his regiment in 1917.

For this monumental painting, the artist transformed an episode from Jules Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> (1864), in which Professor Otto Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the earth. Delvaux showed the professor at left, examining a rock or fossil; behind him stands Axel, who bears a striking resemblance to the artist himself. Under a full moon, a group of women in the background appear like automatons. In the foreground, several figures combine human and vegetal elements; these ambiguous figures seem to embody a primordial, as yet undifferentiated, state. A woman in the right foreground and another in the left middle ground, both in Victorian dress, hold lamps and try in a vain to shed light on the unyielding mystery of the scene. Despite the multitude of naked figures and their detailed description, <em>The Awakening of the Forest</em> retains a detachment that adds to its strange and mysterious effect.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"170.2 × 225.4 cm (67 × 88 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":225.4,"width_in":88.75,"height_cm":170.2,"height_in":67,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"none","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"M.

To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Miró experimented with automatism: “Even a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,” he said, “may suggest the beginning of a picture.” Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the “dream paintings,” which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions. In <em>The Policeman</em>, a large canvas from this group, two biomorphic shapes spring to life as a policeman and a horse, their forms defined by thinly applied white paint against a neutral ocher ground. The form on the left has sprouted five buds that act as fingers, and both forms extrude curves that suggest torsos or mouths. With sketch-like dots and squiggles added to their heads to make eyes and a mustache, Miró’s shapes come to life in a liquid space as animated equivalents of a policeman and his horse.</p>\n","short_description":"After moving to Paris in 1920, Joan Miró met a group of avant-garde artists who advocated merging the everyday world with dreams and the unconscious to produce an absolute reality, or surreality.

Here his strong, assured manner, coupled with the heroic proportions of the figures and the emphasis on the large scythe (an emblem often associated with the Soviet Union)—as well as the social realist sensibilities that prevail throughout his oeuvre, his travels to the Soviet Union, and his writings for and affiliation with left-wing publications such as <em>Masses and Mainstream, Freedomways</em>, and the <em>Daily Worker</em>—suggest that <em>Harvest Talk</em> was inspired by socialist ideals.

The following year, he met the poet Federico García Lorca in Spain. After Lorca was assassinated by agents of Francisco Franco in 1936, Matta began a screenplay, <em>The Earth Is a Man</em>, which he wrote in tribute to the slain hero. The play’s apocalyptic imagery, rapidly shifting perspectives, and emotionally charged language became the principal source of Matta’s visual art over the next five years. The painting <em>The Earth Is a Man</em> represents the culmination of this project and draws on the artist’s earlier compositions, which he called “Inscapes” or “Psychological Morphologies.” In these, using a technique of psychic automatism developed by the Surrealists, Matta created turbulent forms that serve as visual analogues for states of consciousness.</p>\n<p>In this powerful, enigmatic work, forces of brilliant light seem to battle those of darkness. The artist spilled, brushed, and wiped on vaporous washes of paint to render the invisible waves of energy that shape and dissolve a molten, primordial terrain. The painting’s visual intensity evokes the tumultuous eruption of a volcano, such as one Matta had witnessed in Mexico in 1941. Exhibited shortly after its completion in New York City, where he had immigrated at the onset of World War II, the mural- size canvas, with its abstract and visionary qualities, enthralled and influenced a new generation of American artists, who would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.</p>\n","short_description":"Matta referred to this imaginative landscape—his best-known painting—as an “inscape.” He painted it in honor of the poet Federico García Lorca, who was assassinated in 1936, and used the technique of psychic automatism, developed by the Surrealists, to create the composition's turbulent forms.

His use of relatively great depth of field allows him to lead the viewer’s eye to certain details and gloss over other ones.</p>\n<p>Struth’s celebrated <em>Museum Photographs</em> series is composed of monumental images of museum visitors in various stages of observation, captivation, and even distraction. As part of this series, <em>Art Institute of Chicago II</em> depicts a woman pushing a stroller facing Gustave Caillebotte’s famous <em>Paris Street; Rainy Day</em>, while another woman reads the label. The women’s clothing harmonizes remarkably with the palette of the painting, and the gallery’s marble floor seems transformed into a continuation of the wet cobblestones rendered so believably by Caillebotte’s paintbrush. As historian Hans Belting concluded of this work, “One no longer knows what is inside the painting and what is in front of it. . . . We feel like rubbing our eyes when the space in front of the painting transforms itself into a picture that is not separated from the painting.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"187.4 × 222.3 cm (73 3/4 × 87 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":222.3,"width_in":87.5,"height_cm":187.4,"height_in":73.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Chromogenic print mounted to acrylic, edition number three of ten","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Susan and Lewis Manilow","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":"of 10","publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":1991,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":0,"color":{"h":46,"l":63,"s":8,"percentage":0.005349021614017138,"population":1307},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Photograph","artwork_type_id":2,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":37458,"artist_title":"Thomas Struth","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[37458],"artist_titles":["Thomas Struth"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials"],"term_titles":["interiors","photograph","chromogenic processes","paper (fiber product)","Art Institute of Chicago","museums","museum visitors","modern and contemporary art","photography"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-240","classification_title":"photograph","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155","TM-67"],"classification_ids":["TM-240","TM-155","TM-67"],"classification_titles":["photograph","modern and contemporary art","photography"],"subject_id":"TM-12285","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12511","TM-12512","TM-12513"],"subject_ids":["TM-12285","TM-12511","TM-12512","TM-12513"],"subject_titles":["interiors","Art Institute of Chicago","museums","museum visitors"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2982"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)"],"technique_id":"TM-12322","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-12322"],"technique_titles":["chromogenic processes"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"bc03f8ff-68ed-b6d4-7e5f-edc26dc80c88","alt_image_ids":["ce8c461b-e8a8-e16f-4f46-f0e4e562a08f"],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Art Institute of Chicago II, Chicago","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1991.28"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Art Institute of Chicago II, Chicago"],"weight":5088,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-10-18T14:54:23-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:37:19-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:44:27-06:00"}

A member of Surrealist circles in Paris and New York City during the 1930s and 1940s, Carrington settled in Mexico in 1942 after the trauma of fleeing war-torn Europe. Mexico occupied an important place in the imagination of many European artists—André Breton called it the “Surrealist place par excellence”—and for Carrington the country came to be a source of inspiration and wonder.</p>\n<p><em>Juan Soriano De Lacandón</em> was one of the first paintings in which Carrington combined her Surrealist-inspired dreamscapes with Mexico’s history, culture, and ancient practices. Inspired by her study of the indigenous Lacandón people for a 1963 mural commission, <em>The Magical World of the Maya</em> (Museo de Antropología e Historia, Mexico City), the artist portrayed Soriano surrounded by the flora and fauna of ancient Mayan mythology. Bearing the scarification marks of a shaman, he holds in his hand a small jaguar, admired by the Maya as a spiritually powerful creature and a conduit to the underworld. According to native belief, the shaman alone was privileged to assume the form of the jaguar. This notion of animal incarnation may have resonated with Carrington, who adopted the horse as a type of alter ego in her earlier work. In presenting Soriano as a revered holy man, the artist demonstrated her deep admiration for her subject. Her use of precolonial symbolism also suggests her assimilation into the world of her adopted homeland, where she remained until her death.<p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"40.3 × 80.3 cm (15 13/16 × 31 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80.3,"width_in":31.5625,"height_cm":40.3,"height_in":15.8125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Graphite and casein on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Clare Kunny, “Leonora Carrington’s Mexican Vision,” Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 22, 2 (1996), pp. 166-179, fig. 1, (color ill.).","exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2019,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 Leonora Carrington / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":33.5053,"color":{"h":38,"l":54,"s":28,"percentage":0.8812065751567532,"population":3120},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 397","gallery_id":23995,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Modern Art","department_id":"PC-11","artist_id":42671,"artist_title":"Leonora Carrington","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[42671],"artist_titles":["Leonora Carrington"],"category_ids":["PC-11","PC-825"],"category_titles":["Modern Art","Women artists"],"term_titles":["painting","pencil","animals","drawing (image-making)","Surrealism","painting (image making)","snakes","birds","modern and contemporary art","contemporary"],"style_id":"TM-7551","style_title":"Surrealism","alt_style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_ids":["TM-7551","TM-12062"],"style_titles":["Surrealism","contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-12218","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12402","TM-11211"],"subject_ids":["TM-12218","TM-12402","TM-11211"],"subject_titles":["animals","snakes","birds"],"material_id":"TM-2450","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2450"],"material_titles":["pencil"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-3919","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Women artists"],"image_id":"b59b290e-1ea6-dc37-4c86-1a16c948bfed","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Juan Soriano De Lacandón","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2018.285"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Juan Soriano De Lacandón"],"weight":4566,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-01-06T11:17:27-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T15:01:17-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:44:29-06:00"}

He came in contact with a group of artists, including Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, who saw abstraction as an almost spiritual vehicle for the reconstruction of art and society. Their approach, known as De Stijl (The Style), was marked by fundamentals: geometry combined with asymmetry; pure primary colors with black and white; and positive and negative elements. Motivated by his belief in this utopian aesthetic, Vantongerloo joined the De Stijl group in 1917, its founding year.</p>\n<p>In 1919 he embarked on a series of sculptures based on the interrelation of masses. <em>Interrelation of Volumes from the Ellipsoid</em>, the fifth in the group, explores the intersections of a parallel-faced polyhedron within an ovoid volume. To produce this work, the artist mapped the intersecting volumes of forms from different views in order to reveal core geometric units and planes. While this sculpture was inspired by mathematical principles, it is not a sterile, scientific object but, in its realized form, suggests an element of human invention in the mold marks and alterations that Vantongerloo considered part of the artistic process.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"40 × 47 × 26 cm (15 3/4 × 18 1/2 × 10 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":26,"depth_in":10.25,"width_cm":47,"width_in":18.5,"height_cm":40,"height_in":15.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Plaster","inscriptions":"Signed, l.l. with artist's monogram: GV","credit_line":"Through prior gift of Lucille E. and Joseph L.

One of the key figures to integrate artistic developments in Russia with those in Western Europe, he began experimenting with photography seriously in Germany in 1923. Lissitzky was fascinated by the possibilities of photograms, multiple exposures, and what he called <em>fotopis</em>—loosely translatable as “photo-writing”—and he eventually abandoned painting to focus on combined photographic and architectural projects.</p>\n<p>Photograms (images made by placing objects directly on photographic paper and exposing them to light, rather than with a camera) were taken up in Dada and Constructivist circles in different countries between 1919 and 1923. The primitive technology, which dispensed with lenses, permitted a merger of touch and sight that Lissitzky thematized in this picture by having himself (at left) and fellow painter and designer Vilmos Huszár appear to be the twinned pupil of a ghostly eyeball—at once pictured and the embodied agent of picturing.</p>\n<p>This photogram incorporates circular images of El Lissitzky (with pipe) and another artist, Vilmos Huszár. It is printed on gelatin silver paper, the standard black-and-white pho-tographic paper of the 20th century. The absence of an intermediary baryta layer (a distinctive preparatory layer containing white pigment typically present in a gelatin silver print) gives it a very matte surface, while the gray tonality is most likely due to underdevelopment.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"17.6 × 23.7 cm (6 15/16 × 9 3/8 in.); Image/paper: 17.7 × 23.7 cm (6 15/16 × 9 5/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":23.7,"width_in":9.3308,"height_cm":17.6,"height_in":6.9292,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":23.7,"width_in":9.3125,"height_cm":17.7,"height_in":6.9375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver photogram","inscriptions":"Unmarked recto; inscribed verso in the hand of Lissitzky's wife, Sophie Kuppers-Lissitzky: \"Huszar-Lissitzky Holland 1923\"","credit_line":"Mary L. and Leigh B.

After apprenticing in his father’s shop and studying at an art school in his hometown of Le Havre, he went to Paris. In 1905, at the annual Salon d’Automne, he was confronted by the arresting paintings of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Henri+Matisse\">Henri Matisse</a> and others who had begun to employ vibrant, unmixed colors and energetic, rhythmic brushwork. The unbridled intensity of these works prompted a disapproving critic to call the artists &quot;fauves&quot; (wild beasts). Braque quickly joined the group.</p>\n<p>Braque painted <em> Landscape at L’Estaque </em> on his first trip to this town on the French Mediterranean coast. He and other young artists were drawn to Provence, in southeastern France, because of its clear light and because of their reverence for the art of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Paul+Cézanne\">Paul Cézanne</a>, who worked in and around the area until his death in 1906. Braque drew upon Cézanne’s use of faceted brushwork, distorted perspectives, and color to structure his compositions for this view down a steep, tree-lined road. Using a palette of highly saturated reds, oranges, and yellows, Braque evoked a sense of turbulent heat, despite the shade provided by the trees. Cézanne’s influence continued to exert itself over Braque in other, critical ways: in early 1908, he would join <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Pablo+Picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> in the development of a revolutionary new style based on the formal construction that constitutes the core of Cézanne’s vision.

Yet Peale ignored its low status and is now acknowledged as America’s first professional still-life painter and leading practitioner of the genre. Born into an artistic Philadelphia family, Raphaelle was the eldest son of Charles Willson Peale and the nephew of James Peale, both artists; his siblings were, like him, named after famous old master painters (he had brothers named Rembrandt, Titian, and Rubens). Characterized by crisp forms and serenely balanced compositions, most of Peale’s still lifes portray food, crockery, and glassware arranged on a plain shelf, parallel to the picture plane.

Prompted by the comic strips on his children’s gum wrappers, he began to create paintings based on cartoon images. The reductive style that soon emerged became his particular contribution to the idiom known as Pop Art. From around 1961 until 1968, the artist created a group of highly finished black-and-white drawings that demonstrate his subversive use of commercial illustration techniques. In <em>Alka Seltzer</em>, Lichtenstein exploited everyday practices of visual representation and magnified them, indicating the gas bubbles rising over the glass by meticulously scraping away extra spaces from a field of imitation hand-stenciled Benday dots. To signify the reflective surface of the glass, he drew flat black graphite shapes—a parody, like the dots, of the reductive, linecut effect of pulp advertising. The artist’s use of mechanical reproduction conventions served to unify his composition and produce movement and volume on a two-dimensional surface. <em>Alka Seltzer</em> is one of Lichtenstein’s watershed works because it shows the artist summing up his early graphic techniques and introducing what would become his most significant formal preoccupations in the years that followed.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"76.3 × 56.7 cm (30 1/16 × 22 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":56.7,"width_in":22.3229,"height_cm":76.3,"height_in":30.0394,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Graphite and lithographic rubbing crayon pochoir, with scraping, on cream wove paper, fixed ","inscriptions":"Signed and dated verso, in graphite: \"rf Lichtenstein /  1966\"","credit_line":"Margaret Fisher Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Roy Lichtenstein, Drawings and Prints (New York, 1971), p. 119 (ill.), no. 66-2.\n\nBernice Rose, Drawing Now (New York, 1976), pp. 42-43 (ill.), as \"Tablet.\"\n\nRiva Castleman, Seven Master Printmakers, exh. cat.

A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen (seen here at top), while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called <em>tanzaku</em>, waft from the blossoming limbs, the lingering signs of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early medieval aristocratic life.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"144 × 286 cm (56 3/4 × 112 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":286,"width_in":112.5985,"height_cm":144,"height_in":56.693,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Six-panel screen (one of pair); Ink, colors, gold leaf, and gold powder on silk","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

First, however, it was sculpted in raised and sunken relief; only later were some of its surfaces embellished with black, brown, green, yellow, and white paint. It commemorates for all eternity a man named Amenemhat and his wife, Hemet. Before them are two offering tables stacked with food. Their son appears in the upper right at a smaller scale. In addition to the hieroglyphs in the field, a brief text also appears on the top and right border.</p>\n<p>Egyptian art is highly symbolic. The left side of the composition is the dominant position; the placement there of Amenemhat and Hemet conveys their importance. He stands in front of his wife, stressing that he is the head of the household. The social difference between them is indicated by the color of their skin. His is dark reddish brown and hers is yellow; he is active outdoors, while the home is her realm. They both wear traditional clothing and jewelry.</p>\n<p>The goal of the artist was to immortalize the essential elements of his subjects. This representation reflects conventions for portraying the human form as a composite diagram made up of different views. Amenemhat and Hemet are shown with their heads in profile, their shoulders frontal, and their chests, buttocks, and legs in profile. These positions offered the most characteristic and comprehensive views of the human form. Also, depth is represented by height, so the offerings at the top of the composition should be understood as the farthest away.</p>\n<p>The brightly colored, raised-relief hieroglyphs within the scene record the names of the subjects, their lineage, and voice offerings, which refer to the belief that offerings could consist of actual food, images of food, written references to it, or the recitation of prayers that call for provisions. Carved in sunken relief and painted blue, hieroglyphs along the top and right record a conventional prayer for food to sustain Amenemhat and Hemet in the afterlife.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"31.1 × 41.7 × 6.7 cm (12 1/4 × 16 3/8 × 2 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":6.7,"depth_in":2.625,"width_cm":41.7,"width_in":16.375,"height_cm":31.1,"height_in":12.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Limestone and pigment","inscriptions":"The hieroglyphic text names the deceased and family and calls upon the god Osiris to grant them sustenance in the afterlife.\n\n[top] “A gift the king gives consisting of 1,000 of bread, beer, oxen, fowl, alabaster, linen, provisions, and every good thing upon which a god lives”\n\n[right] “The one revered before Osiris, Lord of Busiris, the Great God, Lord of Abydos”\n\n[hieroglyphic captions] \n“Amenemhat”\n\n“Invocation offerings for the ka (soul) of the God’s Father Amenemhat, born of Ip”\n\n“His wife, whom he loves, Hemet, born of Itu”","credit_line":"Museum Purchase Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Thomas George Allen, A Handbook of the Egyptian Collection (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1923), p. 40 (ill.).\n\nKaren Alexander, \"The New Galleries of Ancient Art at the Art Institute of Chicago,\" Minerva, vol. 5, no. 3 (May/June, 1994), p. 29, fig. 1.\n\nEmily Teeter, \"Egyptian Art,\" Museum Studies: Ancient Art at The Art Institute of Chicago, vol. 20, no. 1 (1994), pp. 19-20 (ill.), no. 3.\n\n\"CLEOPATRA; THE ANCIENT WORLD,\" Computer program, 1997, The Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGeoff Emberling and Emily Teeter, “The First Expedition of the Oriental Institute, 1919-1920,” in Pioneers to the Past: American Archaeologists in the Middle East 1919-1920, ed.

The artist had been fascinated with space exploration since the late 1960s, and her later paintings often referenced America’s manned Apollo missions to the moon. Although she had never flown, Thomas began to paint as if she were in an airplane, capturing what she described as shifting patterns of light and streaks of color. “You look down on things,” she explained. “You streak through the clouds so fast. . . . You see only streaks of color.”</p>\n<p><em>Starry Night and the Astronauts</em> evokes the open expanse and celestial patterns of a night sky, but despite its narrative title, the work could also be read as an aerial view of a watery surface, playing with our sense of immersion within an otherwise flat picture plane. The viewer is immersed not only in the sense of organic expanse that this painting achieves, however, but also in an encounter with Thomas’s process: the surface here is clearly constructed stroke by stroke. Meanwhile, the glimpses of raw canvas between each primary-colored mark seem as vivid as the applied paint itself—almost as if the composition were backlit. Thomas relied on the enlivening properties of color throughout her late-blooming career. “Color is life,” she once proclaimed, “and light is the mother of color.” This painting was created in 1972, when the artist was eighty. In the same year, she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at a major art museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</p>\n","short_description":"Alma Thomas was enthralled by astronauts and outer space.

The drawings that she disassembled to create these collages echo the work of her husband, Jackson Pollock, from the same period.

Throughout her career, Krasner employed the technique more consistently than Pollock.</p>\n<p>In <em>Black and White</em>, Krasner not only appropriated her own discarded markings but also referred to Pollock’s early-1940s tactic of quoting Pablo Picasso’s studio subjects. She reversed the gender implications of Picasso’s prototypes by showing, at right, a female figure who may be a painter contemplating her works of art, or perhaps a woman looking in a mirror.

These masterpieces were published together as <em>A System of Architectural Ornament, According with a Philosophy of Man’s Powers</em> by the American Institute of Architects in 1924; this was Sullivan’s final statement about the geometry underlying both natural and man-made forms. In his search for an original American architecture, Sullivan drew his inspiration from nature, not unlike the nineteenth-century American poets and writers whom he emulated. Like them, he intended ornament to function evocatively as well as to represent organic growth, evolving from closed geometric units to open, efflorescent forms. In <em>Impromptu!</em>, the sixteenth of the twenty delicate drawings in his treatise, Sullivan produced one of his most open, vibrant, and fluent compositions. Giving free rein to expansive whiplash appendages and spiral stalks, the architect combined nature’s infinite creative variation and incessant change with an intense emotional expressionism. To convey these poetic nuances, Sullivan’s correlating notation describes the design as entering “the domain of Virtuosity, Romance and Symbolism.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"57.7 × 73.5 cm (22 3/4 × 28 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":73.5,"width_in":28.9375,"height_cm":57.7,"height_in":22.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Graphite on Strathmore paper","inscriptions":"signed and dated at bottom center, \"Louis H.

Between June and December 1937, he undertook a series of drawings, paintings, and prints known as <em>The Weeping Women</em>, in which he focused and elaborated on two figures first presented in <em>Guernica</em>. The figure in this print may also represent the artist’s lover, the Surrealist photographer Dora Maar. In <em>Weeping Woman I</em>, Picasso drew inspiration from contemporary events and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century religious imagery. He modernized the traditional theme of the Virgin Mary lamenting the death of her son. The importance Picasso accorded this etching is suggested not only by its size—it was the largest plate he had yet attempted—but also by the energy he invested in it. He developed the finished print through seven independent states. It seems that he felt the need to work and rework this image, perhaps in an effort to exorcise the demons of war and his difficult relationship with Maar.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Plate: 69.5 × 49.7 cm (27 3/8 × 19 5/8 in.); Sheet: 77.4 × 56.8 cm (30 1/2 × 22 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":49.7,"width_in":19.567,"height_cm":69.5,"height_in":27.3623,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Plate"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":56.8,"width_in":22.3623,"height_cm":77.4,"height_in":30.4725,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Drypoint, aquatint, and etching, with scraping, on copper in black on ivory laid paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior acquisition of the Martin A.

While she produced work in the wake of Pop Art, her interest in the quotidian had nothing to do with issues of commerce or the media but rather with the illusionistic process of image making itself. Since the early 1970s, the artist has created exacting depictions of such expansive subjects as desert floors, ocean waves, the surface of the moon, and star-studded night skies—the latter derived from satellite photographs. To create her smooth, velvety compositions, Celmins often applies multiple layers of pigment to her canvases, sanding each down before she adds the next. Each work is further modulated through the use of a wide range of black, white, and silvery-gray tones. With its jewel-like imagery and suggestion of vastness, <em>Night Sky #2</em> is at once romantic and unsettling. Lacking the anchor of a horizon, a humanly scaled reference point, or a recognizable landmark, viewers may have difficulty determining their relationship to the image. The enormity of the subject presented on a relatively small scale (the work is less than two feet wide) furthers this sense of disorientation.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"45.7 × 54.6 cm (18 × 21 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":54.6,"width_in":21.5,"height_cm":45.7,"height_in":18,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Alkyd on canvas mounted on aluminum","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Ada S.

Along the perimeter of the <em>thangka</em>, the five sisters of long life ride their mounts, accompanying Milarepa wherever he preaches his doctrine.

With the Herbert A. Jacobs House, he began a series of curved designs that were specifically constructed for the particular topographical character of a site in order to take advantage of solar energy. Wright had designed the Jacobs family’s former residence near Madison, Wisconsin; however, they wished to escape congestion and thus enlisted him to design a second home further out in the country. In this perspective view, Wright emphasized the home’s innovative features by depicting it at midday. Direct sunlight casts a bold swath of inky black shadow that dramatizes the interior curve of the building’s semicircular design. The south facade bends around a circular sunken garden. Large windows and glass doors welcome the weak winter sun while the wide, overhanging roof shields against summer’s direct rays. To protect from strong winds and to insulate the home, the house was set into a berm. The thick masonry walls that flank the facade link the building to its natural setting while offering a textural contrast to the glass front and airy interior.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"58.1 × 73.5 cm (22 7/8 × 28 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":73.5,"width_in":28.9375,"height_cm":58.1,"height_in":22.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ink on paper with graphite guidelines","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Herbert and Katherine Jacobs","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":25,"fiscal_year":1982,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":10.5002,"color":{"h":37,"l":47,"s":10,"percentage":0.010636495076564736,"population":59},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Architectural Drawing","artwork_type_id":34,"department_title":"Architecture and Design","department_id":"PC-5","artist_id":37362,"artist_title":"Frank Lloyd Wright","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[37362],"artist_titles":["Frank Lloyd Wright"],"category_ids":["PC-5","PC-154","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Architecture and Design","Chicago Artists","Essentials"],"term_titles":["graphite","presentation drawing","houses","20th Century","drawing (image-making)","ink","architecture","exterior","trees","architectural drawing","architecture","paper (fiber product)"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-920","classification_title":"presentation drawing","alt_classification_ids":["TM-126","TM-103"],"classification_ids":["TM-920","TM-126","TM-103"],"classification_titles":["presentation drawing","architectural drawing","architecture"],"subject_id":"TM-12493","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12085","TM-13302","TM-11205"],"subject_ids":["TM-12493","TM-12085","TM-13302","TM-11205"],"subject_titles":["houses","architecture","exterior","trees"],"material_id":"TM-2410","alt_material_ids":["TM-2398","TM-2982"],"material_ids":["TM-2410","TM-2398","TM-2982"],"material_titles":["graphite","ink","paper (fiber product)"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3919"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)"],"theme_titles":["Chicago Artists","Essentials"],"image_id":"7b673fe8-545a-8073-7dbc-583df25b6032","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Mr. and Mrs. Herbert A.

The artist’s new emphasis on large-scale compositions, bold forms, and brilliant colors shows his awareness of the work of his contemporaries Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as does his focus on Arcadian landscapes, a theme he had not previously explored. Part of a series of four canvases painted for his dealers, Josse and Gaston Bernheim, between 1916 and 1920, Earthly Paradise demonstrates Bonnard’s new, daring investigations of light, color, and space. Here the artist used foliage to create a proscenium-like arch for a drama involving a brooding Adam and recumbent Eve. The contrast Bonnard established between the figures seems to follow a tradition in which the female, presented as essentially sexual, is connected with nature, while the male, essentially intellectual, is able to transcend the earthly. Heightening the image’s ambiguity is an array of animals, including birds, a monkey, rabbits, and a serpent (here reduced to a garden snake). This less-than-Edenic paradise may reflect the artist’s response to the destruction of Europe during World War I, which was still raging when he began the painting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"130 × 160 cm (51 1/4 × 63 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":160,"width_in":63,"height_cm":130,"height_in":51.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.l.: \"Bonnard\"","credit_line":"Estate of Joanne Toor Cummings; Bette and Neison Harris and Searle Family Trust endowments; through prior gifts of Mrs. Henry C.

This new artistic process was celebrated for its remarkably sharp detail and praised as a “democratic art” that brought portraiture into reach for the masses. Within a few years, thousands of daguerrean portrait studios had sprung up all over the United States, among them the one that Samuel J. Miller owned in Akron, Ohio. Although most of the likenesses made in commercial studios were formulaic and not very revealing of the subject’s character, this portrait of Frederick Douglass—an escaped slave who had become a lauded speaker, writer, and abolitionist agitator—is a striking exception. Northeastern Ohio was a center of abolitionism prior to the Civil War, and Douglass knew that this picture, one of an astonishing number that he commissioned or posed for, would be seen by ardent supporters of his campaign to end slavery. Douglass was an intelligent manager of his public image and likely guided Miller in projecting his intensity and sheer force of character. As a result, this portrait demonstrates that Douglass truly appeared “majestic in his wrath,” as the nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton observed.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"14 × 10.6 cm (5 1/2 × 4 1/8 in., plate); 12.1 × 8.8 cm (4 3/4 × 3 1/2 in., mat opening); 15.2 × 12 × 1.4 cm (6 × 4 3/4 × 1/2 in., plate in closed case); 15.2 × 24 × 2 cm (6 × 9 1/2 × 3/4 in., plate in open case)","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Daguerreotype","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Major Acquisitions Centennial Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Rossen, Susan F. 1999. \"Introduction.\" Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, vol. 24. no. 2. p. 142.\n\n“African Americans in Art: Selections from The Art Institute of Chicago.” edited by Susan F.

Two rectangular canvas panels—one yellow, the other gray—are joined to form an eight-foot square. Each canvas is pulled across a deep (two and one-eighth-inch) stretcher and painted with a combination of oil and beeswax. The stretchers and thick, opaque pigment give <em>Rodeo</em> a sense of weight and a sculptural presence. Like all of Marden’s paintings, <em>Rodeo</em> is insistently handmade. The artist laid multiple layers of the medium over his canvas panels, adding an extraordinary sense of tactility to this relatively simple composition. The line joining the two panels may suggest a horizon line, and thus a landscape. The juxtaposition of two rectangular fields also recalls the work of Mark Rothko.

One of the artist’s most spectacular achievements to date, <em>Clown Torture</em> consists of two rectangular pedestals, each supporting two pairs of stacked color monitors; two large color-video projections on two facing walls; and sound from all six video displays. The monitors play four narrative sequences in perpetual loops, each chronicling an absurd misadventure of a clown (played to brilliant effect by the actor Walter Stevens). In “No, No, No, No (Walter),” the clown incessantly screams the word <em>no</em> while jumping, kicking, or lying down; in “Clown with Goldfish,” the clown struggles to balance a fish bowl on the ceiling with the handle of a broom; in “Clown with Water Bucket,” the clown repeatedly opens a door booby-trapped with a bucket of water that falls on his head; and finally, in “Pete and Repeat,” the clown succumbs to the terror of a seemingly inescapable nursery rhyme. The simultaneous presentation and the relentless repetition creates an almost painful sensory overload. With both clown and viewer locked in an endless loop of failure and degradation, the humor soon turns to horror.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Four-channel video installation with 2 projections and 4 monitors, color, sound; approx. one hour","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Watson F.

Like most of Still’s mature work, <em>Untitled</em> is a sheer wall of paint, imposing and self-sustaining, that makes no concessions to conventional notions of beauty or pictorial illusionism. This painting’s textural effects give it an insistent, complex materiality. Dominated by blacks applied with both a trowel and brushes, the surface is by turns reflective and chalky, granular and smooth, feathery and leaden. These variegated black surfaces are even more emphatic because their continuity is broken by areas of blank canvas and white paint. Like veins in igneous rock, streaks of orange, yellow, and green paint are embedded in the black voids. Mediating between the light and dark masses are areas of crimson, heightened at the edges, as if inflamed, by bright orange.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"290.2 × 406.4 cm (114 1/4 × 160 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":406.4,"width_in":160,"height_cm":290.2,"height_in":114.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Frank G.

Here, the slightly out-of-focus quality reinforces the motion of an unknown, glamorously dressed woman descending a set of stairs. The work’s silver-blue brushwork suits the elegance of the subject with her glistening evening gown and diaphanous scarf. The composition’s subject and title evoke Marcel Duchamp’s famous work <em>Nude Descending a Staircase</em> (1912; Philadelphia Museum of Art). When it was exhibited in the United States at the 1913 Armory Show, Duchamp’s painting shocked Americans for its radical abstraction. Rather than honoring this modernist icon, Richter protested it, stating that he “could never accept that it had put [an end], once and for all, to a certain kind of painting.” Indeed, in the Art Institute’s work, Richter produced a hauntingly sophisticated image that floats between reality and illusion.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"198 × 128 cm (79 × 51 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":128,"width_in":51,"height_cm":198,"height_in":79,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"On verso, signed and dated “Richter 65” “Sept. 65” at middle right; “No. 1 (200x130 cm)” on bottom stretcher; “unverkäuflich” and “Eigentümer: Sammlung Wasmuth” written at top right and crossed out; “Frau, die Treppe herabgehend” written at top right.","credit_line":"Roy J. and Frances R.

He creates profoundly aesthetic experiences that are often aimed at disrupting viewers’ habits of perception. In the mid-1960s the artist adopted the medium of flashing neon in order to critically examine the role of language in visual art. Inspired by its hypnotic aura and non-art aesthetic, Nauman began using this quintessentially commercial medium in an ironic way, as a vehicle for wordplay, puns, and jokes. The artist created this neon sign for an invitational sculpture exhibition held in Chicago in 1985. Three pairs of words, antithetical in their connotations, line the six-foot circumference: <em>life</em> and <em>death</em>, <em>love</em> and <em>hate</em>, and <em>pleasure</em> and <em>pain</em>. In the center, <em>human</em>, <em>animal</em>, and <em>nature</em> are repeated in stacked sets of two. Each word blinks independently, ordered so that over several minutes all possible permutations are displayed. Juxtapositions of colors produce optical illusions that create a jarring, visceral effect.

Inspired by Abraham Lincoln’s 1862–63 Emancipation Proclamation, <em>The Freedman</em> reflects not only Ward’s aspiration to create relevant statements on pressing issues of the day but also his abolitionist sentiments. Using antiquity as his inspiration, he depicted a seminude man seated on a tree stump who has just been liberated from the shackles that bound him to slavery. Ward broke artistic convention by showing the former enslaved person as master of his own destiny, not a man reliant on white men for freedom. The vestiges of chains, potent symbols of his bondage, dangle from both wrists, and his muscular body, turned to look over his shoulder, is contained within a formal, triangular composition. <em>The Freedman</em> was modeled from life and is generally considered among the first naturalistic sculptural representations of an African American. Shortly after <em>The Freedman</em> was first exhibited in 1863, art critic James Jackson Jarves effectively summarized the work’s power: “We have seen nothing in our sculpture more soul-lifting or more comprehensively eloquent. It tells in one word the whole sad story of slavery and the bright story of emancipation.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"49.9 × 40 × 23.9 cm (19 5/8 × 15 3/4 × 9 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":23.9,"depth_in":9.375,"width_cm":40,"width_in":15.75,"height_cm":49.9,"height_in":19.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Bronze","inscriptions":"Signed on base: J.Q.A.

Frankl immigrated to New York in 1914 and established his own gallery. There he began to design interiors and champion the skyscraper as a source of a uniquely American modernist vision. The impetus behind the <em>Skyscraper Cabinet</em>, however, was distinctly rural. Frankl spent the summer of 1925 in Woodstock, New York, sketching ideas for new furniture designs and renovating his cabin. In an effort to organize his books, he fitted boards together to create a cabinet with “a rather large, bulky lower section and a slender, shallow upper part going straight to the ceiling. It had a new look; the neighbors came and said, ‘It looks just like the new skyscrapers.’” From then on, Frankl experimented with spare, geometric furniture that mimicked the setback contours of New York skyscrapers. By 1926 these pieces were touted in <em>Good Furniture</em> magazine as the “sky-scraper type of furniture, which is as American and as New Yorkish as Fifth Avenue itself.” The Art Institute’s monumental cabinet epitomizes Frankl’s designs. Its geometric form rests on a sharply molded base and consists of a bottom cabinet section surmounted by a series of compartments and shelves arranged in a pyramidlike fashion. Smooth, unadorned surfaces exemplify the tenets of modernist design.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"213.4 × 83.8 × 40 cm (84 × 33 × 15 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":40,"depth_in":15.75,"width_cm":83.8,"width_in":33,"height_cm":213.4,"height_in":84,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Painted wood","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Antiquarian Society through Mr. and Mrs. Thomas B.

It is rife with threats of danger, from the menacing fire in the distance to the sibylline figure in the foreground with an hourglass and a butterfly, both symbols of the inevitability of death.

Less common are individual portrayals of a cow and calf, like this relief, which most likely came from the walls of a Hindu temple, possibly from central India, and can be dated to around the ninth century.

Around 1909 Léger began to experiment with geometric shapes, complementary colors, and strong outlines, although his paintings remained largely nonrepresentational until after World War I. His involvement in the war had a profound impact on his work. In the years following, he introduced volumetric forms that resembled pistons and pipes into his compositions, joining others in the Parisian vanguard in charting a more sober, conservative course that placed renewed emphasis on objective observation. Substituting hard metallic tubes for pliant flesh and flat patterned disks for soft and dense pillows, the artist updated the classical figure of the odalisque (a female slave or concubine often pictured in the history of art as a reclining nude) with his particular blend of Cubism and machine aesthetics. <em>Reclining Woman</em> demonstrates Léger’s interest in producing “everyday poetic images”: paintings in which the manufactured object is the “principal personage,” shown as precisely as possible to reveal an absolute sculptural value rather than sentimental associations. This work exemplifies the Purist style, a kind of industrial classicism that focused on utilitarian objects. Léger hoped that through such paintings, art would become accessible to the whole of modern society rather than to just a privileged few.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"64.5 × 92 cm (25 1/2 × 36 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92,"width_in":36.25,"height_cm":64.5,"height_in":25.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"F LEGER/22\"","credit_line":"A Millennium Gift of Sara Lee Corporation","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Paintings from the Cummings Collection, exh. cat.

At the same time, her references engage broad aspects of German folklore and culture through meticulous reproductions of quotidian objects, many of which she formally manipulates with shifts in scale and color.

Yet the same year he painted his radical image, Munch was experimenting with other styles and themes. Frequent visits to Paris and Berlin between 1889 and 1893 brought the Norwegian artist into direct contact with the Impressionists and Symbolists. These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in <em>The Girl by the Window</em>, made soon after his return home to Norway.</p>\n<p>In the dead of night, a young girl in her nightgown stands in a darkened room gazing out at the city. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate everything in the room, save a suggestion of a piece of furniture at the lower right, create an unsettling and enigmatic scene. Loosely applied, somber brown tones mingle with violets and blues, evoking a feeling of melancholy and anticipation. The window functions as a symbolic barrier, separating the interior from the outside world. The sense of mystery is deepened and complicated by the fact that we cannot see the expression on the girl’s face, nor do we know what she covertly observes. She in turn appears unaware that, as she gazes from behind the curtain at something unknown outside, the artist and implied viewer are watching her.</p>\n","short_description":"Edvard Munch’s life and art have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety.

This textile is covered with Qur’anic verses that were likely recited as they were inscribed in tightly composed Arabic script, thereby forging a link between the written word and its sound. The calligraphy is arranged in a fluid checkerboard pattern and organized around a series of painted shapes. The checkered motifs evoke magic squares, arrangements of numbers that, when added together in any direction, always amount to the same sum. In Sufism, such numerological devices are held to be a powerful reflection of divine mystery. Like words, they are filled with sacred blessings, or <em>Baraka</em>. The elongated quadruped figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of the name Muhammad. Attached amulets further punctuate the textile. These commonly encase small squares of folded paper bearing sacred writing. Across Senegal, learned Sufi practitioners applied their esoteric knowledge of sacred writing to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing, and spiritual protection. This textile was likely prepared by a practitioner who lent or rented it to clients as needed.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"255.2 × 178.8 cm (100 1/2 × 70 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":178.8,"width_in":70.375,"height_cm":255.2,"height_in":100.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Four panels joined: cotton, plain weave; painted; amulets of animal hide and felt attached by knotted strips of leather","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"African and Amerindian Purchase Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Kathleen Bickford Berzock \"Talismanic Textile,\" The Silk Road and Beyond: Travel, Trade, and Transformation, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, 33, 1 (2007), pp. 87-88.\n\nKathleen Bickford Berzock, editor. 2019.

Such objects served as containers for medals or jewels. This example is richly veneered with marquetry panels of scrolls, strapwork, and vines executed in engraved gilt copper on a ground of tortoiseshell. Framing the panels are strips of ebony and pewter. The coffer also features gilt bronze mounts in the form of male, female, and animal heads. The escutcheon in the center of the front panel may depict the head of Apollo, his long hair braided on either side of his face and gathered in a knot below his chin.

Sullivan’s most distinctive commercial structures. The centerpiece of this thirteen-story building was the Trading Room, a dramatic, double-height space that was designed for the daily operations of the Stock Exchange and filled with Sullivan’s lush organic ornament and stenciled patterns. Despite the singular beauty of this room, it served its original function for just fourteen years and was occupied only sporadically thereafter. In the late 1960s, the building was targeted for demolition and became the focus of an important, although ultimately unsuccessful, preservation battle. During the course of demolition, photographer and activist Richard Nickel was working to salvage ornament from the building when the unstable structure collapsed and he was tragically killed. As a tribute to Nickel and Sullivan, sections of the Trading Room stencils, molded pilaster capitals, and art glass were preserved and in 1977 the Art Institute created a complete reconstruction of this significant room in a new wing of the museum. At the same time, the monumental entry arch of the Stock Exchange was erected on the museum grounds near the corner of Monroe Street and Columbus Drive.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Room is roughly 5,704 square feet (not including gallery)","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Mixed media recreation of room","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Three Oaks Wrecking Company","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Vinci, John, ed. 1989.

She soon became obsessed with photography, reveling in its messy magic and focusing more on the overall effects of her pictures than on technical perfection. Although she made portraits of some of the most important men of her day, Cameron’s female subjects helped her to explore the realm of mythology and imagination in highly allegorical and literary pictures. She delighted in dressing and posing friends, relatives, and servants as the Virgin Mary, Queen Esther, or Shakespeare’s faithful Cordelia. Julia Jackson, Cameron’s niece, was one of the few female sitters who posed for the photographer as herself. Known as a great beauty throughout her life, she was a favorite subject for Cameron, who took dozens of photographs of her over the course of ten years. In April 1867, shortly before Jackson’s wedding to her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, Cameron made a series of head-on portraits of the young bride-to-be that alternately reveal Jackson as noble, tender, and vulnerable. In this photograph, made after the wedding, Cameron captured Jackson’s mature beauty and extraordinary strength.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"34.2 × 26.3 cm (13 1/2 × 10 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":26.3,"width_in":10.375,"height_cm":34.2,"height_in":13.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Albumen print","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"The Mary and Leigh Block Endowment Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Newhall, Beaumont and Nancy Newhall. 1958. \"Masters of Photography.\" George Braziller. p. 50.\n\nHill, Brian. 1973. \"Julia Margaret Cameron, A Victorian Family Portrait.\" New York. pl. 22.\n\nMulligan, Therese and David Wooters. 1999. \"Photography from 1839 to today: George Eastman House, Rochester, NY.\" Cologne: Taschen. p. 368.\n\nWesterbeck, Colin. 2003. \"Mrs. Herbert Duckworth,\" Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, vol. 29, no. 2. p. 39.  \n\nSharp, Robert V., Elizabeth Stepina and Susan E.

Among the Art Institute’s rich holdings of Kelly’s works, <em>Red Yellow Blue White and Black</em> stands apart: with startling clarity, this painting marks the moment at midcentury when Kelly’s pure abstraction emerged in its mature form. After serving in World War II, the artist returned to Europe in 1948, living and working in France for the following six years. While abroad, Kelly expanded his practice of direct observation of nature and architectural forms into an experimental, rigorous study of abstraction. He made <em>Red Yellow Blue White and Black</em> in 1953 while still in France, creating it just as he was beginning to uncover the nearly infinite possibilities of monochrome, color spectrum, chance ordering, and multipanel composition. In the painting, Kelly centered the black panel so that it both divides and joins the three panels on either side of it, while the white panels simultaneously separate colors and pair them off. The blue panels at either end close and unify the sequence. Kelly’s multipanel monochromes rely on the edges where sections meet, instead of handmade marks, to express their form. This seven-panel painting is the largest in a sequence of Paris-based works widely considered to be the artist’s finest and most influential early statements on canvas.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"99.1 × 350.2 cm (39 × 138 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":350.2,"width_in":138,"height_cm":99.1,"height_in":39,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas; 7 joined panels","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Anstiss and Ronald Krueck Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>Bois 133 2015</p>","publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":"New York, Paintings 1951–56, Betty Parsons Gallery, 1956 (checklist no. 6 as Sanary II).","provenance_text":"[Matthew Marks Gallery, New York] sold to Anstiss and Ronald Krueck, 2001; gifted to the Art Institute of Chicago in incrimates 2001–2017.","edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2001,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Ellsworth Kelly Foundation","has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":82.1135,"color":{"h":6,"l":42,"s":80,"percentage":0.6578237894963873,"population":1342},"latitude":41.880629434834,"longitude":-87.621508575949,"latlon":"41.880629434834,41.880629434834","is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 295","gallery_id":25471,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":35235,"artist_title":"Ellsworth Kelly","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[35235],"artist_titles":["Ellsworth Kelly"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials"],"term_titles":["oil on canvas","oil painting","colors","oil paint (paint)","contemporary","painting (image making)","painting","modern and contemporary art","canvas"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-66","classification_title":"oil on canvas","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_ids":["TM-66","TM-9","TM-155"],"classification_titles":["oil on canvas","painting","modern and contemporary art"],"subject_id":"TM-12479","alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":["TM-12479"],"subject_titles":["colors"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"8b12267b-6fde-3424-281a-0cb74bb7e36a","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["37782459-1cfa-e4cb-f50d-6b32897b4581"],"sound_ids":["37782459-1cfa-e4cb-f50d-6b32897b4581"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Red Yellow Blue White and Black II","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2001.157"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Red Yellow Blue White and Black II"],"weight":10420,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-05-08T14:24:02-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T14:27:48-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:31-06:00"}

His works frequently have the formal clarity of documentary photography or photojournalism, but he often relies on staged or constructed artifices. This image is the result of two years of work, during which the artist fused countless photographs of both documentary and fabricated scenes into a single, surreal whole. After taking pictures in two Vancouver cemeteries over the course of several months, Wall built an aquatic system in his studio, crafting the tank from a plaster cast of an actual grave. With the aid of marine-life specialists, the artist cultivated a living, underwater ecosystem identical to one found off the coast of Vancouver. In the finished product, the two worlds are married through a technical process that presents the illusion of a water-filled grave. <em>The Flooded Grave</em> therefore challenges the notion of the photograph as the record of a single moment in time; instead, it is an elaborate fantasy on the subconscious life of the image it projects.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"228.6 × 282 cm (90 × 111 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":282,"width_in":111,"height_cm":228.6,"height_in":90,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Transparency in light box","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Promised gift of Pamela J. and Michael N.

One of the defining moments in his widely influential career, <em>“Untitled”</em> can be considered a self-portrait in the form of words and dates. First realized in 1989, the work expanded with subsequent installations until the artist’s premature death in 1996, and can continue to shift in ongoing manifestations. The portrait joins historical events and enigmatic personal milestones into a running text placed close to the ceiling. Such an installation is reminiscent of traditional friezes carved on the faces of public architecture, including the facade of the Art Institute’s 1893 Allerton Building, which includes artists’ names chiseled into a horizontal band. By offering clues to a personal history in a commemorative form normally dedicated to institutional use, Gonzalez-Torres undercuts the public and official in favor of the private and subjective, reminding us that an individual’s identity is not always reducible to an image captured on canvas or etched in marble. <em>“Untitled”</em> can change each time it is installed and may be presented in an infinite variety of ways. Its owner is obliged to consider adding (or subtracting) events, including ones subsequent to the artist’s death, ensuring that it remains relevant and dynamic.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Dimensions vary with installation","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Paint on wall","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"The Art Institute of Chicago, bequest of Carolyn Spiegel; Watson F.

Nine years later, he created the first of five painted versions of <em>The Sick Child</em>, all representing Sophie just prior to her death. Munch later described the process of painting these works as a form of technical and personal catharsis.</p>\n<p>Due to the great success of the paintings and his own psychological preoccupations, in 1894–96 Munch made three prints based on the motif, of which <em>The Sick Child I</em> was the last. In 1896 the artist traveled to Paris to experiment with new print-making processes and work with respected printers such as Auguste Clot, hoping to gain the commercial success that had previously eluded him in the French capital. There he made this, his first color lithograph, which features Sophie’s head silhouetted against a pillow. Munch printed the lithograph with several different stones and a variety of color combinations: he made the keystone either black or red and added up to four other color stones in combinations of blue, gray, red, yellow, reddish brown, and purple-blue. Munch was keenly aware of the symbolic associations of various colors, and the icy blue and stark black of this impression suggest the haunting pallor of death.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image: 42 × 57.2 cm (16 9/16 × 22 9/16 in.); Sheet: 48.3 × 63.5 cm (19 1/16 × 25 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":57.2,"width_in":22.5197,"height_cm":42,"height_in":16.5355,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":63.5,"width_in":25,"height_cm":48.3,"height_in":19.0158,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Transfer lithograph printed from two stones in pale blue and black ink on ivory wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Major Acquisitions Fund","catalogue_display":"<p>Woll 72 VIII/X</p><p>Schiefler 59 III/III</p>","publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":3,"fiscal_year":2003,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":13.0758,"color":{"h":180,"l":48,"s":2,"percentage":0.03255262214130045,"population":177},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Print","artwork_type_id":18,"department_title":"Prints and Drawings","department_id":"PC-13","artist_id":44014,"artist_title":"Edvard Munch","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[44014],"artist_titles":["Edvard Munch"],"category_ids":["PC-13","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Prints and Drawings","Essentials"],"term_titles":["lithograph","children","lithography","paper (fiber product)","ink","illness","portraits","print","prints and drawing","paper","wove paper"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-71","classification_title":"lithograph","alt_classification_ids":["TM-17","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_ids":["TM-71","TM-17","TM-4","TM-145"],"classification_titles":["lithograph","print","prints and drawing","paper"],"subject_id":"TM-10118","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12473","TM-8658"],"subject_ids":["TM-10118","TM-12473","TM-8658"],"subject_titles":["children","illness","portraits"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":["TM-2398","TM-3074"],"material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-2398","TM-3074"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)","ink","wove paper"],"technique_id":"TM-3859","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3859"],"technique_titles":["lithography"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"d661b811-c78c-ac16-b39c-442cbd8c517f","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"The Sick Child I","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2003.1"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Sick Child I"],"weight":2163,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:19:19-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T16:20:52-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:36-06:00"}

The grid format of his composition includes frames in which the mother’s and daughter’s faces and hands are captured together, as well as separate frames in which they gaze back at the artist.

The artist takes her images from the mass media, particularly newspapers and television, and she manipulates them to achieve her desired effect. Characterized by spontaneous brushwork and a subjective use of color, her works merge art-historical and popular-culture references with private, autobiographical allusions. As a white woman who was raised under Apartheid rule in South Africa, some of her strongest works tackle the complicated themes of racial politics. This representation of a black African albino exposes race as a social construct that fails to correspond to identity. By choosing a subject whose very existence complicates the notion of racial categorization, and by rendering his skin tone and hair color in a sickly green hue, Dumas insisted on destabilizing the division between black and white. This work ultimately questions the ability of both skin color and paint to carry meaning.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"130 × 110 cm (51 1/8 × 43 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":110,"width_in":43.25,"height_cm":130,"height_in":51.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mary and Leigh Block","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2003,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":11.8733,"color":{"h":150,"l":48,"s":4,"percentage":0.12207095091725564,"population":1027},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 295","gallery_id":25471,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":54948,"artist_title":"Marlene Dumas","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[54948],"artist_titles":["Marlene Dumas"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-825","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Women artists","Essentials"],"term_titles":["oil on canvas","20th Century","painting (image making)","oil paint (paint)","albinoism","oil painting","canvas","portraits: African subject","African","men","painting"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-66","classification_title":"oil on canvas","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-66","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["oil on canvas","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12471","alt_subject_ids":["TM-8595","TM-12470","TM-10121"],"subject_ids":["TM-12471","TM-8595","TM-12470","TM-10121"],"subject_titles":["albinoism","portraits: African subject","African","men"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":["TM-4273"],"technique_ids":["TM-3891","TM-4273"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)","oil painting"],"theme_titles":["Women artists","Essentials"],"image_id":"6158570b-9aa3-c570-209e-f2e1e54e960a","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Albino","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2002.597"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Albino"],"weight":2849,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-02-24T15:08:25-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T14:43:59-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:38-06:00"}

Combining a hallucinatory palette with expressionist brushwork, his paintings have a mysterious, often melancholic air. Doig works exclusively from found images, drawing inspiration from film stills, newspaper clippings, personal photo albums, record album covers, and the work of earlier artists such as Edvard Munch and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The image of the two men in <em>Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre</em> derives from a photograph taken when the artist was working as a dresser at the London Coliseum. One night, after a production of Igor Stravinsky’s burlesque ballet <em>Petrouchka </em>(1911), Doig and a friend donned costumes from the performance and comically posed for a snapshot. The artist initially used the photo as the basis for a figure study; he then superimposed the two figures on a landscape he borrowed from an antique postcard, which depicts the vista from an old German tavern, Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre. In Doig’s version, the view has undergone strange chromatic shifts, resulting in a fantastical, nocturnal scene that resembles a theatrical backdrop. The men at the gate are an otherworldly presence; the winding path behind them seems to lead to another realm beyond the edge of the painting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"196 × 296 cm (77 1/8 × 116 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":296,"width_in":116.5,"height_cm":196,"height_in":77.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Nancy Lauter McDougal and Alfred L.

These hangings display a very limited repertoire of patterns, including one or two red ships, a single blue ship, tree images, buildings, and rows of stylized anthropomorphic figures. The indigenous name for textiles of this type, <em>palepai</em>, probably goes back to the old Javanese word <em>lepih</em>, which means “to fold” or “to double.” <em>Palepai</em> served as markers of status and perhaps even denoted descent. Indeed, title, claim to leadership, and certain other privileges accompanied the possession of <em>palepai</em>. These textiles were also important requisites during rites of passage, such as marriage, death, or accession to a higher rank—events that were thought to be unstable moments fraught with danger.

His earliest works—black-and-white silent films—are indebted to 1960s structural filmmaking, wherein the mechanics of shooting and projection become essential components of the film’s subject. His more recent work explores the relation between the medium and the spectator. At once confrontational and seductive, these colossally scaled works transform a purely visual experience into a visceral event. Presented as a single installation, <em>Caribs’ Leap</em> and <em>Western Deep</em> are linked by the theme of descent. The dual-screen projection <em>Caribs’ Leap</em> juxtaposes luminous scenes of the beachfront on the island of Grenada—the birthplace of McQueen’s parents—with irregular images of tiny figures falling through a vast sky. The latter pay homage to the island’s indigenous Caribs, who in 1651 leapt to their death rather than surrender to the invading French. In <em>Western Deep</em>, the viewer takes a nightmarish journey into the hot, noisy depths of a South African goldmine. Presented and considered together, these two films suggestively liken modern mining conditions to a historical act of genocide.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Caribs' Leap: 8mm and 35mm color film, sound, transferred to two-channel digital color video (projection), 28:53 min. loop, and 12:06 min. loop, edition number two of four; Western Deep: 8mm color film, sound, transferred to digital video (projection), 24:12 min. loop; edition number two of four","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Marilynn Alsdorf Discretionary, Arabella Decker, Wilson L.

Kienle’s work belongs to a larger body of German Renaissance and Baroque sideboard silver that includes cups in the form of three-dimensional horses, lions, stags, and other animals. Horse-and-rider figural groups have their roots in earlier Greek and Roman sculpture. Renaissance princes often had themselves depicted in monumental form, wearing Classical dress or contemporary armor and sitting atop prancing or rearing steeds. That Kienle based this silver cup on an earlier sculptural model is suggested by the existence of a bronze group of virtually identical subject, composition, and scale, made in northern Italy during the second half of the sixteenth century. Kienle masterfully rendered the differentiation of human and equine musculature through the contrast of silver and silver-gilt surfaces, thus animating the already dynamic subject.</p>\n","short_description":"This 17th-century drinking cup, made for display on a buffet or sideboard, is a rare example of the work of Hans Ludwig Kienle, a German silversmith who specialized in depicting animals, including horses, lions, and stags.

His decidedly unimposing, antiheroic works explore the cultural, economic, historical, and social conditions of his native Germany with a detached, often humorous, sensibility. Much of Schütte’s work addresses the almost existential difficulty postwar German artists encounter in attempting to create monuments and memorials. As such, it evidences an ongoing preoccupation with themes of death, mourning, and collective memory.

As early as the first century, the region’s natural harbors invited exchange with partners in the Persian Gulf and Western India. Later the Portuguese, Omani, and British imposed their authority on its inhabitants. With each conquering state, newly imported goods and practices took root as symbols of authority and power among the Swahili elite. The upright form of the <em>kiti cha enzi</em>chair bears strong resemblance to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century chairs imported from Portugal and Spain, as well as to Portuguese- and Spanish-influenced examples made in India. Comparisons have also been made with chairs from the Mamluk period (1250–1517) in Egypt. In any case, the Swahili version is clearly the result of foreign influences that have been artfully synthesized and reshaped by local artisans. Most such chairs in collections today date from the nineteenth century and were made in large, specialized workshops. They could be found conspicuously displayed in wealthy households along the Swahili Coast into the first half of the twentieth century.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"125.7 × 75.6 × 72.4 cm (49 1/2 × 29 3/4 × 28 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":72.4,"depth_in":28.5,"width_cm":75.6,"width_in":29.75,"height_cm":125.7,"height_in":49.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Wood, ivory, and cotton fiber","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Marshall Field V","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"James de Vere Allen, “The Kiti Cha Enzi and other Swahili Chairs,” African Arts, vol. 22, no. 3 (May 1989), pp. 54–63, 88; 55 (ill.).\n\nKathleen Bickford Berzock, “Chair (Kiti Cha Enzi),” Notable Acquisitions at the Art Institute, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 32, 1 (2006), pp. 10-11, 94.\n\nKathleen Bickford Berzock, \"Chair (Kiti Cah Enzi),\" The Silk Road and Beyond: Travel, Trade, and Transformation, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, 33, 1 (2007), pp. 55-56.\n\nGary van Wyk. 2013. \"Art Practice in Tanzania: Landscape, Soundscape, Engurance.\" In\nShangaa: Art of Tanzania, exh. cat., Gary van Wyk, ed., (Queens Community College Art Gallery Press, 2013), pg. 72, fig. 1.25 (ill.).","exhibition_history":"Art Institute of Chicago, The Silk Road and Beyond: Travel, Trade, and Transformation, Sept. 30, 2006–Apr. 22, 2007, cat. pp. 55-56 (ill).","provenance_text":"Studio Sanaa, Mombasa, Kenya, by about 1979; sold to unnamed owner, Los Angeles, Calif., about 1979; sold to Davis Gallery, New Orleans, La., 1989; sold to the Art Institute, 2004.","edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":43,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":26.2886,"color":{"h":45,"l":53,"s":54,"percentage":0.001489782882767123,"population":16},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 137","gallery_id":2147470998,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Furniture","artwork_type_id":6,"department_title":"Arts of Africa","department_id":"PC-1","artist_id":50993,"artist_title":"Swahili","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[50993],"artist_titles":["Swahili"],"category_ids":["PC-1","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Arts of Africa","Essentials"],"term_titles":["wood (plant material)","chair","plant-derived motif","carving","swahili","ivory","cotton (fiber)","ivory","cotton","wood","arts of Africa","Arts of Africa","african art","19th century","furniture","african Art","Eastern and Southern Africa"],"style_id":"TM-6451","style_title":"swahili","alt_style_ids":["TM-14183","TM-13203","TM-13489","TM-13579"],"style_ids":["TM-6451","TM-14183","TM-13203","TM-13489","TM-13579"],"style_titles":["swahili","Arts of Africa","19th century","african Art","Eastern and Southern Africa"],"classification_id":"TM-11745","classification_title":"chair","alt_classification_ids":["TM-137","TM-11728","TM-84","TM-14182","TM-13486","TM-76"],"classification_ids":["TM-11745","TM-137","TM-11728","TM-84","TM-14182","TM-13486","TM-76"],"classification_titles":["chair","ivory","cotton","wood","arts of Africa","african art","furniture"],"subject_id":"TM-11839","alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":["TM-11839"],"subject_titles":["plant-derived motif"],"material_id":"TM-2431","alt_material_ids":["TM-2442","TM-3081"],"material_ids":["TM-2431","TM-2442","TM-3081"],"material_titles":["wood (plant material)","ivory","cotton (fiber)"],"technique_id":"TM-3863","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3863"],"technique_titles":["carving"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"6f071f3a-a59e-ee80-6528-ed1fa8670090","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Chair (Kiti Cha Enzi)","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2004.476"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Chair (Kiti Cha Enzi)"],"weight":4092,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-02T14:06:58-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:29:43-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:47-06:00"}

This dynamic image is rendered by the artist’s distinctively expressive method of painting. After defining the composition with large areas of ink spilled onto the paper or worked with a broad brush, Li gradually rendered mass and solidity with denser layers and then allowed the paper to dry before adding details with a small, finely tapered brush.

Conflating conventional cinematic structure with avant-garde techniques, Julien subverts stereotypical portrayals of black and gay subjects, forcing viewers to question accepted representational archetypes. Produced collaboratively with Venezuela-born choreographer Javier De Frutos, <em>The Long Road to Mazatlán</em> is a modern cowboy story. Shot in and around San Antonio, Texas, the film captures the erotically charged interchanges between a young Hispanic man and the emotionally unavailable cowboy he pursues. Shot in lush color and layered imagery, the protagonists play out, as actors and at times as dancers, the subtle drama of the everyday, performing within carefully constructed environments. Through selected editing and the use of a three-screen installation, the artist composes a mise-en-scène that explores the social construction of masculinity within mythic landscapes of the American West.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"16mm black-and-white and color film, sound, transferred to three-channel digital video (rear projection on screen); 17:44 min. loop","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Donna and Howard Stone","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2007,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":80.3085,"color":{"h":207,"l":34,"s":95,"percentage":0.3413819884776334,"population":1767},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Film, Video, New Media","artwork_type_id":33,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":102445,"artist_title":"Isaac Julien","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[102445],"artist_titles":["Isaac Julien"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials"],"term_titles":["black-and-white film","new media","21st Century","cowboys","Texas","video","color film","time-based works","funerary"],"style_id":"TM-12913","style_title":"21st Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12913"],"style_titles":["21st Century"],"classification_id":"TM-10383","classification_title":"new media","alt_classification_ids":["TM-12314","TM-11076"],"classification_ids":["TM-10383","TM-12314","TM-11076"],"classification_titles":["new media","time-based works","funerary"],"subject_id":null,"alt_subject_ids":["TM-12458","TM-12459"],"subject_ids":["TM-12458","TM-12459"],"subject_titles":["cowboys","Texas"],"material_id":"TM-3441","alt_material_ids":["TM-12063","TM-3443"],"material_ids":["TM-3441","TM-12063","TM-3443"],"material_titles":["black-and-white film","video","color film"],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"d8ef4d0a-eafe-383d-69c9-4b041ba60899","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"The Long Road to Mazatlán","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2007.41"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Long Road to Mazatlán"],"weight":1119,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-06-15T15:20:58-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T13:38:44-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:50-06:00"}

In <em>Delphine</em>, which takes as its primary subject wild dolphins interacting with humans, the artist worked for the very first time with untrained animals in their natural habitat. Complex spatial thinking is key to Thater’s projects; she understands installation art as a dialogue between sculpture and architecture. Projected on a large scale—onto entire ceilings, walls, and floors—her work thoroughly transforms the physical realities of the spaces it inhabits. This generic and spatial fluidity blurs conventional boundaries between the work and the viewer. The artist also insists on revealing how her images are made. Shot in both digital video and film, <em>Delphine</em> was edited without regard for separating the different media. Clarity and grain flow together as the immediacy and flatness of video gives way to the depth of film. These self-conscious production methods are mirrored by Thater’s particular aesthetic of presentation: she always leaves her equipment in full view inside the installation. This transparent approach, the artist insisted, “does not, as some people might have us believe, preclude transcendence. This is ultimately my point—that neither magic nor superficial beauty is required to approach the sublime.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Continuous loop","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Five-channel digital color video with sound (projection), nine-monitor cube, light filters, and existing architecture;  artist's proof from an edition of three","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Donna and Howard Stone New Media Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2005,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2005 Diana Thater","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":87.9316,"color":{"h":189,"l":49,"s":98,"percentage":0.03077870113881194,"population":281},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Film, Video, New Media","artwork_type_id":33,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":81537,"artist_title":"Diana Thater","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[81537],"artist_titles":["Diana Thater"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831","PC-825"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials","Women artists"],"term_titles":["underwater","20th Century","video recording (process)","video","new media","diving","seas","animals","dolphins","video monitors","time-based works","funerary"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-10383","classification_title":"new media","alt_classification_ids":["TM-12314","TM-11076"],"classification_ids":["TM-10383","TM-12314","TM-11076"],"classification_titles":["new media","time-based works","funerary"],"subject_id":"TM-12454","alt_subject_ids":["TM-9131","TM-12286","TM-12218","TM-12456"],"subject_ids":["TM-12454","TM-9131","TM-12286","TM-12218","TM-12456"],"subject_titles":["underwater","diving","seas","animals","dolphins"],"material_id":"TM-12063","alt_material_ids":["TM-13392"],"material_ids":["TM-12063","TM-13392"],"material_titles":["video","video monitors"],"technique_id":"TM-13390","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-13390"],"technique_titles":["video recording (process)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials","Women artists"],"image_id":"f7fc4517-71b2-8c45-aaa6-32642345063e","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Delphine","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2005.93"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Delphine"],"weight":1273,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2021-09-21T07:18:29-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-10T15:14:31-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:51-06:00"}

This wood sculpture is a powerful example of the inﬂuence of trends from northern Europe on the art of Spain in the second half of the fifteenth century through the importation of works of art and craftsmen. The angular, dancing rhythm of the saint’s pose and the tight, graphic quality of the details of his shield, hair, and wings may reﬂect sources in northern European prints, such as the engravings of Master E. S.

Throughout his career, he explored the functional simplicity and visual clichés that characterize processes of mechanical reproduction. Initially preoccupied with the visual immediacy of cartoons, Lichtenstein embraced the technical constraints of graphic illustration, applying them to painting. <em>Mirror #3 (Six Panels)</em> is among the most ambitious, summarizing canvases in the artist’s <em>Mirror</em> series (1969–72). Like his famous cartoon images, these paintings were inspired by popular culture sources. Studying illustrations from furniture and glass-company catalogues, Lichtenstein familiarized himself with pictorial conventions used to represent reflection. The work also references the long tradition of rendering mirrors in art, a theme that was explored by artists from Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso. Lichtenstein was perhaps most invested, however, in broadly generic questions of surface and support. Only stylized gleam and shadow are reflected in his mirror; thus, the puzzling, fragmented, even conceptual abstraction becomes the real subject of the work.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"305 × 335 cm (120 × 132 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":335,"width_in":132,"height_cm":305,"height_in":120,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil and Magna on two sets of three joined canvases","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Anstiss and Ronald Krueck Collection, facilitated by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2005,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Estate of Roy Lichtenstein","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":95.0533,"color":{"h":48,"l":45,"s":97,"percentage":0.2588300323576357,"population":1667},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":35480,"artist_title":"Roy Lichtenstein","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[35480],"artist_titles":["Roy Lichtenstein"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Essentials"],"term_titles":["graphic","painting (image making)","Pop Art","oil paint (paint)","painting","panels","mirrors","oil painting","canvas","magna","acrylic paint","Abstract","oil on canvas"],"style_id":"TM-7221","style_title":"Pop Art","alt_style_ids":["TM-7536"],"style_ids":["TM-7221","TM-7536"],"style_titles":["Pop Art","Abstract"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-66"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-66"],"classification_titles":["painting","oil on canvas"],"subject_id":"TM-12256","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12257","TM-12258"],"subject_ids":["TM-12256","TM-12257","TM-12258"],"subject_titles":["graphic","panels","mirrors"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124","TM-12055","TM-2407"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124","TM-12055","TM-2407"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","canvas","magna","acrylic paint"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":["TM-4273"],"technique_ids":["TM-3891","TM-4273"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)","oil painting"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"4f3baaee-14ea-81e0-6252-447ab15a9b1d","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Mirror #3 (Six Panels)","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2005.18"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Mirror #3 (Six Panels)"],"weight":6377,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-13T12:00:04-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:28:37-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:54-06:00"}

The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews.

Although details of the piece’s carving tie it unmistakably to Pabst, the design cannot be attributed conclusively to a particular hand. The designer was influenced by the writings of Christopher Dresser and Charles Eastlake, British reformers who advocated honesty of construction and conventionalized ornament. Instead of carving the decoration deeply in order to achieve a naturalistic effect, Pabst used a cameo technique, cutting through the burled elm veneer to reveal the darker walnut beneath and creating a striking color contrast and flattened style of decoration.</p>\n<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, dining-room furniture typically featured ornament that was intended to reinforce ideals of hospitality and gentility. Here the cabinet doors display designs recounting Aesop’s fable of the fox and the stork, a tale in which each animal offers the other some food in a serving dish from which the guest cannot eat, thus proving the importance of true hospitality. The panels are virtually identical to images found on curtain designs illustrated in Eastlake’s 1868 book <em>Hints on Household Taste</em>, a text that was widely influential in the United States.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"256.5 × 185.4 × 62.2 cm (101 × 73 × 24 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":62.2,"depth_in":24.5,"width_cm":185.4,"width_in":73,"height_cm":256.5,"height_in":101,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Walnut and burled elm","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of the Antiquarian Society","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Annual Report (Art Insitute of Chicago, 2004–2005), p. 16 (ill.).","exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Cataloged","internal_department_id":21,"fiscal_year":2005,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":true,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":59.6469,"color":{"h":61,"l":87,"s":0,"percentage":0.22543054645805055,"population":2003},"latitude":41.8791151876153,"longitude":-87.6219437643884,"latlon":"41.879115187615,41.879115187615","is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Furniture","artwork_type_id":6,"department_title":"Arts of the Americas","department_id":"PC-3","artist_id":103575,"artist_title":"Daniel Pabst","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[103575],"artist_titles":["Daniel Pabst"],"category_ids":["PC-831","PC-3"],"category_titles":["Essentials","Arts of the Americas"],"term_titles":["furniture","walnut","fleur de lis","19th century","carving","elm","birds","animals","flowers","furniture","furniture making"],"style_id":"TM-13203","style_title":"19th century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13203"],"style_titles":["19th century"],"classification_id":"TM-76","classification_title":"furniture","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-76"],"classification_titles":["furniture"],"subject_id":"TM-12001","alt_subject_ids":["TM-11211","TM-12218","TM-10482","TM-9132"],"subject_ids":["TM-12001","TM-11211","TM-12218","TM-10482","TM-9132"],"subject_titles":["fleur de lis","birds","animals","flowers","furniture"],"material_id":"TM-3609","alt_material_ids":["TM-3560"],"material_ids":["TM-3609","TM-3560"],"material_titles":["walnut","elm"],"technique_id":"TM-3863","alt_technique_ids":["TM-4045"],"technique_ids":["TM-3863","TM-4045"],"technique_titles":["carving","furniture making"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"ee3d039d-d4dc-1f0d-c4a4-0066d34b438a","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["f85bee6b-d18b-5577-a9e6-f429421b4654","4e268279-199f-5b22-87e1-db2355bb6ab7"],"sound_ids":["4e268279-199f-5b22-87e1-db2355bb6ab7"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":["f85bee6b-d18b-5577-a9e6-f429421b4654"],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Sideboard","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2005.51"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Sideboard"],"weight":1689,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-11T10:21:44-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:11:37-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:45:56-06:00"}

These different treatments of spatial illusion resulted in compositions with a highly graphic feel that is enhanced by the decorative patterning on the depicted objects. It is clear that such still-life images did not have realism as a goal. Instead, chaekgeori (defined as “painting[s] of books and associated things”) were seen as conveyers of cultural values. They were most often displayed within studios or schools and reflected reverence for scholarship and learning. In this screen, scholarly tools are depicted along with flowers, plants, food, rare imported objects, and religious implements. These motifs express varied meanings; for example, eggplant represents the promise of a long life, while musical instruments symbolize harmony among people. Such a profusion of auspicious meanings indicates that chaekgeori may not have been restricted to the scholarly environment; they may also have served as talismans ensuring harmony within the home and beyond.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"162.5 × 415.2 cm (64 × 163 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":415.2,"width_in":163.625,"height_cm":162.5,"height_in":63.9688,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ink and color on paper mounted on silk brocade with wooden frame","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Wirt D.

The combination of cool painted plaster and silky mink tufts illustrates the Surrealist interest in uniting different elements to spark a new reality. For the Surrealists, the best means of provoking this revolution of consciousness was a special kind of sculpture that, as Dalí explained in a 1931 essay, was “absolutely useless . . . and created wholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangible reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character.” Dalí’s essay, which drew upon the ideas of Marcel Duchamp’s readymades, inaugurated object making as an integral part of Surrealist activities.</p>\n<p>Influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, Dalì envisioned the idea of a cabinet transformed into a female figure, which he called an “anthropomorphic cabinet.” <em>Venus de Milo with Drawers</em> is the culmination of his explorations into the deep, psychological mysteries of sexual desire, which are symbolized in the figure of the ancient goddess of love.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"98 × 32.5 × 34 cm (38 5/8 × 12 3/4 × 13 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":34,"depth_in":13.375,"width_cm":32.5,"width_in":12.75,"height_cm":98,"height_in":38.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Painted plaster with metal pulls and mink pom-poms","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mrs. Gilbert W.

He infused the Chinese-inspired ink painting (<em>nanga</em>) that was gaining favor among intellectuals in Kyoto with a purely Japanese aesthetic and humor. <em>Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun</em> is a snapshot of contemporary life in Japan presented from Taiga’s unique perspective. The print depicts pilgrims making offerings to the Jizo nun, a holy woman believed to be able to communicate with the bodhisattva Jizo, who had the power to save souls in the afterlife.</p>\n<p><em>Group Pilgrimage</em> contains an inscription relating the story of the Jizo nun. Taiga was a master calligrapher, poet, and seal carver and was well versed in all forms of writing, from ancient seal script to cursive kana. Here he rendered the inscription in a cursive, informal style very much in keeping with the spontaneity of the painting itself. Taiga was also renowned for his use of finger painting and other odd techniques. Although opinions vary as to whether or not this work is a finger painting, it is clear that Taiga did not use a traditional brush. It seems likely that this could be a “paper twist painting,” in which the artist worked with scraps of twisted paper charged with ink.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"54.9 × 123.2 cm (21 5/8 × 48 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":123.2,"width_in":48.5,"height_cm":54.9,"height_in":21.625,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Hanging scroll; ink on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Kate S.

Among the many uses of ikats was their role as a component of a woman’s dowry. A woman would have worn this robe at weddings and other special occasions, and at her funeral it would have been draped over her bier. The choice of fabric was determined by a woman’s age and status. In general, young women wore bright colors and large patterns, while older women dressed in more sober hues. Most women wore garments made of inexpensive native cotton fabrics, but wealthy women owned robes made of silk and cotton-wefted ikat fabric. Ikat is an ancient technique involving precise and repeated tying (binding) and dyeing of threads or yarns before they are woven. The warp threads are dyed, while the weft threads usually remain solid in color. These threads intersect at right angles during the weaving process; the results are complex patterns in dazzling color combinations that produce a slightly blurred visual effect known by the Persian word <em>abr</em> (“cloud”).</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"134 × 167.5 cm (52 13/16 × 54 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":167.5,"width_in":54,"height_cm":134,"height_in":52.8125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Silk and cotton, plain weave; warp-resist-dyed (ikat); edged with silk twined embroidery","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Guido Goldman","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"The Art Institute of Chicago. \"The Silk Road and Beyond: Travel, Trade, and Transformation\" Museum Studies, vol. 33, no. 1 (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2007), p. 25.","exhibition_history":"Art Institute of Chicago, Elizabeth F.

He wrote of feeling “delight and oppression and what the Romantics called ‘emotion in the face of Nature.’” By expressing his thoughts in these terms, Ernst linked himself with the spiritual landscape tradition of Romanticism, which conceived of an invisible realm at work in the natural world.</p>\n<p>This dark and mysterious forest scene dates to one of the most creative periods of Ernst’s career. Spurred by the Surrealist leader André Breton’s proclamation of “pure psychic automatism” as an artistic ideal, he developed the innovative technique of frottage, his term for the method of reproducing a relief design (like the surface of a piece of wood) by laying paper or canvas over it and rubbing it with a pencil, charcoal, or another medium. In <em>Forest and Sun</em> Ernst used this technique to create a petrified forest, which he imbued with a sense of primordial otherworldliness. By scraping away almost-dry paint on the canvas (a process he called grattage), the artist produced the encircled sun at the center of the composition. Ernst painted six variations of the forest and sun theme. As in the other five canvases, the tree trunks suggest a letter in the artist’s name: in this case, a capital M.</p>\n","short_description":"Surrealist Max Ernst used an unusually wide range of styles and techniques to create his works.

Their paintings celebrate modernity—the speed, thrill, and especially the danger of factories, airplanes, automobiles, locomotives, and steamships.

In <em>Festival in Montmartre</em>, he depicted the centrifugal motion of a carousel and the liberating, yet destabilizing, effects of color, speed, and sound. The artist presented this work in his first solo exhibition in 1913, writing in the catalogue, “My object has been to convey the sensation of a body, lighted by electric lamps and gyrating in the darkness of the boulevard. The shapes of the pink pigs and of the women seated on them are subordinate the whole, the rotary movement of which they follow while undergoing displacement from head to foot and vice versa.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"88.9 × 116.2 cm (35 × 45 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":116.2,"width_in":45.75,"height_cm":88.9,"height_in":35,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Bequest of Richard S.

As the artistic director of Tiffany Studios located in Corona, New York, he approved all patterns but created relatively few lamps himself. Clara Driscoll, head of the Women’s Glass Cutting Department, was likely responsible for this shade and base. Driscoll began working for Tiffany in 1888, and she designed the majority of the firm’s lamps before she left the company in 1908 or 1909. Driscoll created at least eight dragonfly shades. This example is distinguished by its large size, glass cabochons, and the placement of insects’ bodies along the lower edge. While Tiffany Studios mass-produced these shades and bases, the firm varied the color scheme of each object to heighten the sense of handcraftsmanship. This daring design became one of Tiffany’s most popular and was made through 1924.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"86.4 × 57.2 cm (34 × 22 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":86.4,"height_in":34,"diameter_cm":57.2,"diameter_in":22.5,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Favrile glass and bronze","inscriptions":"Shade model 1507 stamped: TIFFANY STUDIOS NEW YORK 1507\nBase model 355 impressed: TIFFANY STUDIOS NEW YORK 5858\nTIFFANY STUDIOS NEW YORK","credit_line":"Roger and J.

Designed to contain offerings of meat in ritual ceremonies, this vessel was cast with a lengthy inscription on its interior bowl. The text commemorates a solemn ritual ceremony at the imperial court of the Zhou, the second dynasty recorded in Chinese texts, and explains that Captain Wang, a noble official who had been rewarded for his loyal service to the Zhou king, commissioned this vessel to honor his deceased father and record the occasion for succeeding generations. Together with the inscription, the vessel’s shallow profile and austere surface decor date it to the early ninth century BC. Although the monsterlike masks that project from each leg display animal imagery common on older bronzes, the two registers of hooked, ribbonlike bands that encircle the bowl preserve only traces of early dragon or bird patterns. The transition from zoomorphic to abstract surface designs marks a significant turning point in the art of early Chinese bronzes. Recent archaeological discoveries of similar bronze vessels in China indicate that this cauldron was most likely buried as part of a large hoard.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"49 × 43 cm (19 3/8 × 16 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":43,"width_in":16.9375,"height_cm":49,"height_in":19.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Bronze","inscriptions":"Inside of the cauldron, Shi Wang Ding ( 師朢鼎 )：\n大師小子師朢曰：不(_丕)_顯皇 \n考劺公，穆穆克盟氒心、伳(_哲)\n氒德，用辟于先王，势(_得)_屯(_純)\n亡敃。朢肈(_肇)_帥井(_型)_皇考，虔 \n攵(_夙)_夜出内(_入)_王命，不敢不 \n壐(_遂)_不壑。王用弗俶(_忘)_聖人 \n之後，多蔑曆易(_賜)_休。朢敢 \n對剣(_揚)_天子不(_丕)_顯魯休，用 \n乍(_作)_朕皇考劺公丬(_尊)_鼎。師 \n朢侔(_其)_萬年子子孫孫永寶用。 \n \nTranslation:\nThe Grand Captain's young son Captain Wang says: \"Illustriously august \ndeceased-father Duke Jiu was beautifully capable of making accordant his heart and making wise \nhis virtue, with which he served the past kings, and gained purity \nwithout flaw.

In a career that spanned more than thirty-five years, he was an architect of civic, domestic, and ecclesiastical buildings; an innovative interior decorator and designer of furniture, textiles, and theater sets; and an articulate critic of art and architecture. Godwin first designed his ebonized sideboard, of which this is a variant model, for his own dining room in 1867, and he subsequently reconsidered the form over the next two decades. In its appearance, the sideboard represents a turning away from the weight of contemporary Gothic Revival aesthetics and a move toward a reductionist sensibility expressed through the balance of solids and voids. This spare style gained Godwin some notable contemporary clients, among them James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. In his 1904 study <em>The English House</em>, the influential German critic Hermann Muthesius wrote that Godwin’s furniture, including this sideboard, foreshadowed the more modern look that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. While calling Godwin’s creations “wildly picturesque,” Muthesius concluded that the overall effect was “one of elegance.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"181.6 × 255.3 × 50.2 cm (71 1/2 × 100 1/2 × 19 3/4 in.)

The artist posited his influential ideas most clearly in over 1,200 wall drawings, which he conceived between 1968 and his death in 2007. LeWitt shared the creation of his work with other makers—trained draftsman and, in most cases, assistants hired from local art schools or institutions—extending the collaborative possibilities of his artwork indefinitely. Through the 1980s, the artist used only traditional drawing media such as crayon, ink, and pencil. In the following decade, however, acrylic paint became his dominant medium. <em>Wall Drawing #821</em> depicts a signature motif with monumental solemnity. The work comprises a grid of horizontal, vertical, and opposing diagonal lines, which were LeWitt’s most fundamental geometric and linear building blocks. The artist usually rendered this motif graphically; in this work, however, the figure-ground relationship is articulated solely through the juxtaposition of subtly differentiated matte and gloss paints.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Variable: 365.8 × 365.8 cm (144 × 144 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":365.8,"width_in":144,"height_cm":365.8,"height_in":144,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Variable"}],"medium_display":"Acrylic paint","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gifts of Judith Neisser and Mary and Leigh Block; Norman Waite Harris Purchase Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"James Rondeau, “Sol LeWitt,” in Art Institute of Chicago, The Essential Guide (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1997), 151 (color ill.).\n\nNicholas Baume, Sol LeWitt: Wall Pieces [John Kaldor Art Project 11], exh. cat.

The slide projector was adopted as an artistic vehicle in the 1960s and 1970s for public performance-based work, and <em>The Ballad</em> codifies more performative presentations by the artist in the clubs and cinemas of 1980s New York’s artistic demimonde.</p>\n<p>Goldin’s pictures, like images of family vacations or holidays, embrace photography’s potential for immediacy, emotion, and anecdote. Unlike such snapshots, however, they capture Goldin, her friends, and her family in moments of intimacy—lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization—and depict the rollercoaster of human emotions that accompanies these moments. In this way, <em>The Ballad</em> offers a more exposed, and potentially more honest, version of the traditional domestic slideshow.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Running time: 43 min.","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Multimedia installation (720 color slides and programmed soundtrack)","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior bequest of Marguerita S.

As the field has matured, Hernan Díaz Alonso, principal architect of the Los Angeles firm Xefirotarch, has emerged as a significant figure; his studio’s grotesque, animal-like forms exemplify just how far digital practice has evolved. Shown here is the model for <em>Sur</em>, the firm’s winning entry for the Museum of Modern Art/P.S.1 Young Architects Program. The piece is composed of an acrylic surface that supports three-dimensional forms printed from nylon composite. The actual pavilion was constructed of bent aluminum tubing clad with reflective fabric sheathing and fiberglass benches and platforms painted Ferrari red.

Known for transforming freely available waste materials such as bubble wrap, off-cuts of wood, plastic piping, and rope into furniture and other products, the brothers are keen to situate the craftsman’s skills at the center of their projects. In some of their designs, the Campanas use cast-off materials in a way that invites social commentary; in others, they combine rigid steel and informally layered everyday elements, suggesting the confluence of Modernist aesthetics and popular culture that is constantly at play in their work. Corallo Chair, their most ambitious piece to date, illustrates their interest in operating at the frontier of art and design. Made of bent steel wire and painted bright coral, each chair is handcrafted, ensuring that no two are the same. The branchlike form, taken from shapes found in nature, is a response to the chair’s function as an outdoor seating element. Ultimately, however, what anchors the Campanas’ efforts is a divine optimism that something beautiful can result from limited means.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"90.2 × 139.7 × 99.9 cm (35 1/2 × 55 × 39 5/16)","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Bent steel wire and epoxy paint","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by the Architecture & Design Society in honor of \"The Friends of the Society\"","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":25,"fiscal_year":2007,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":55.8216,"color":{"h":204,"l":46,"s":82,"percentage":0.001547880880716078,"population":11},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Design","artwork_type_id":31,"department_title":"Architecture and Design","department_id":"PC-5","artist_id":104141,"artist_title":"Campana Brothers","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[104141],"artist_titles":["Campana Brothers"],"category_ids":["PC-5","PC-109","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Architecture and Design","Art Institute Icons","Essentials"],"term_titles":["furniture","furniture","21st Century","steel","bending","painting (coating)","coral","design"],"style_id":"TM-12913","style_title":"21st Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12913"],"style_titles":["21st Century"],"classification_id":"TM-76","classification_title":"furniture","alt_classification_ids":["TM-13174"],"classification_ids":["TM-76","TM-13174"],"classification_titles":["furniture","design"],"subject_id":"TM-9132","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12333"],"subject_ids":["TM-9132","TM-12333"],"subject_titles":["furniture","coral"],"material_id":"TM-2538","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2538"],"material_titles":["steel"],"technique_id":"TM-4299","alt_technique_ids":["TM-4005"],"technique_ids":["TM-4299","TM-4005"],"technique_titles":["bending","painting (coating)"],"theme_titles":["Art Institute Icons","Essentials"],"image_id":"43051d12-64db-d7f1-e885-af68b9b910b1","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Corallo Chair","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2006.277"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Corallo Chair"],"weight":4361,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-10-12T17:17:10-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:40:05-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:17-06:00"}

I was instantly drawn to it. It was not only a beautiful log, but to my eyes, it was perfectly embedded in the meadow where it had fallen decades earlier. Pressure from the weather, insects, ultraviolet radiation, and gravity were evident. Total collapse appeared to be no more than a handful of years away. I was inspired to make a sculpture and studied many other logs, but I realized that I was only interested in this particular one.</p>\n<p>At one point, I determined that its armature could be its pneuma, the Greek word for <em>breath</em>, <em>wind</em>, or <em>life</em>. Later, I considered making an inflatable sculpture but realized that the tailoring of the form would bring an unwanted complexity to the surface. It then struck me that the breath or life of the sculpture could be manifested in the very act of sculpting. Making a wood carving of the log by starting from the inside and working my way out would bring a trajectory of life and intentionality to this great fallen tree. With several friends, I transported the tree, cut apart by a chainsaw, back to my Los Angeles studio. Silicone molds were taken and a fiberglass version of the log was reconstructed. This was sent to Osaka, Japan, where master woodworker Yuboku Mukoyoshi and his apprentices carved my vision into reality using Japanese cypress (<em>hinoki</em>). I was drawn to the woodworkers because of their tradition of copying work that is beyond restoration. In Japan, when an old temple or Buddha can no longer be maintained, it is remade. I visited Japan often and had a difficult time bringing this work to completion and allowing it to go out into the world. When I asked Mr. Mukoyoshi about the wood and how it would behave over time, he told me that the wood would be fine for 400 years and then it would go into a crisis; after two hundred years of splitting and cracking, it would go into slow decline for another 400 years. I realized then that the wood, like the original log, had a life of its own, and I was finally able to let my project go and hopefully breathe life into the world that surrounds it.&quot;</p>\n<p>— Charles Ray</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Three elements: 172.7 × 762 × 233.7 cm (68 × 300 × 92 in.); 63.5 × 426.7 × 208.3 cm (25 × 168 × 82 in.); and appro×. 60.5 × 400 × 200 cm (25 × 150 × 78 in.)","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Cypress","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gifts of Mary and Leigh Block, Mr. and Mrs. Joel Starrels, Mrs. Gilbert W.

Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20).

Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20). In 1922 Schindler left Wright’s firm to establish his own practice in Los Angeles, where his commissions were mostly residential buildings.

These elements are closely connected to architectural decoration—especially stuccowork and wall tiles—and they were shared by potters, stucco carvers, and weavers.

Around 1728 Augustus conceived of replicating the animal kingdom in porcelain for display in a Baroque palace that he was transforming into a showcase for his collections of Asian and Meissen ceramics. This porcelain zoo was intended for the long gallery on the main floor of the palace. By 1733, the year the king died, more than thirty different models of birds and almost forty animals had been made, many by the sculptor Johann Joachim Kändler, who worked at Meissen from 1731 to 1775. Kändler drew this vulture from life, which allowed him to animate his work with the creature’s quintessential spirit. Such porcelain animals remain the most vivid expression of Augustus’s wish, as elector and king, to possess and rule over the natural world.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"58 × 43 cm (22 13/16 × 16 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":43,"width_in":16.9,"height_cm":58,"height_in":22.8,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Hard-paste porcelain, polychrome enamels","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Harry and Maribel G.

Attracted to the group’s desire to transform society through the exploration of the unconscious, she challenged traditional ideas about gender and sexuality through her intimate photographic self-portraits, collages, and sculptures. For <em>Object</em>, Cahun altered a number of seemingly unrelated components—a doll’s hand, a cloud-shaped piece of wood, and a tennis ball painted with a wide-open eye—to produce a startling psychological resonance. The eye, in particular, a key Surrealist symbol of inner perception, also suggests female anatomy. On the base of the work, Cahun added the French phrase, “The Marseillaise is a revolutionary song, the law punishes counterfeiters with forced labor.” Much like the rest of the work, the inscription is a juxtaposition of disparate elements: the first, a well-known slogan from France’s antifascist coalition, the left-wing Popular Front, and the other, a phrase from Belgian currency. In combining these phrases, Cahun seems to point an accusatory finger at the supposed “revolutionary” leaders of France—a rare direct reference to politics in a Surrealist artwork. Her assemblages were typically ephemeral and made to be photographed; <em>Object</em> is the only sculptural work by the artist known to still exist in its original form.</p>\n","short_description":"Claude Cahun was closely associated with the Paris Surrealists of the 1930s.

Meticulously made and attentive to observed reality, her works nevertheless balance representation and abstraction, seeking an oscillation or equilibrium between the two. For the past two decades, Fish has worked in reference to the given materials, surfaces, and construction of her Chicago home and study—a former storefront dating to 1922—but another approach to &quot;found&quot; subjects took priority in the late 1980s. As the artist wrote in a statement in 1990, “With each painting I attempt to reconcile a singular response to an aspect of Nature. . . . Living within an urban setting, my work has grown to reflect the isolated framing of the natural world; and I find through developing each painting a parallel process of selection and reduction.”</p>\n<p>In <em>Bloom</em>, an intimate and intense early work, Fish describes what might be read as vegetation in magenta, lavender, and deep green passages of paint that appear at once to hover above and recede into the pictorial plane. There is no evident light source, yet the painting as a whole seems to glow, as if backlit. More than a particular kind of bloom, this work captures the experience of seeing—or of straining to see—garden forms in twilight. Fish constructed a sense of fading, fluctuation, and ultimate visual instability through repeated horizontal and vertical brush marks. Progressive layers of point generated a lush, tactile surface that seems to behave organically rather than predictably.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"76.2 × 68.5 cm (30 × 27 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":68.5,"width_in":27,"height_cm":76.2,"height_in":30,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil and wax on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Anonymous gift","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2007,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":31.8867,"color":{"h":329,"l":32,"s":45,"percentage":0.36623095415859735,"population":2899},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":null,"department_id":null,"artist_id":8364,"artist_title":"Julia Fish","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[8364],"artist_titles":["Julia Fish"],"category_ids":["PC-154","PC-825"],"category_titles":["Chicago Artists","Women artists"],"term_titles":["oil painting","wax","painting","Chicago","contemporary","painting (image making)","oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12075","alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":["TM-12075"],"subject_titles":["Chicago"],"material_id":"TM-2438","alt_material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2438","TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["wax","oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Chicago Artists","Women artists"],"image_id":"1dfb3e9b-09ad-5d87-f53c-dba52c1f5aee","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Bloom","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2007.73"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Bloom"],"weight":1075,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-03T23:30:16-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:28:47-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:29-06:00"}

The next year, he returned home and worked at various Chicago firms until he founded his own practice in 1937. He is best known for Chicago’s Marina Towers, America’s first mixed-use urban-housing complex, which he completed in 1967. Two decades later, Goldberg made plans for the even more ambitious River City. Conceived as part of a huge marina along the south branch of the Chicago River, the development was to consist of a vast complex of linked towers housing thousands of residents. Believing that architecture should address the needs of the many, Goldberg envisioned River City as a self-sufficient environment that would foster a sense of community. Six clusters of seventy-two-story buildings, featuring the architect’s now trademark curvilinear concrete shell construction and cantilevered balconies, would wind a serpentine path along the river’s edge. Although the full scope of River City was never realized, a scaled-back version was built in 1987. Despite its diminished proportions, River City drew high praise and was hailed by the <em>New York Times</em> as “a remarkable space, unusually lyrical and soft in feeling for a structure finished in harsh concrete.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"45.6 × 57.9 cm (18 × 22 13/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":57.9,"width_in":22.8125,"height_cm":45.6,"height_in":18,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ink and graphite on tracing paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"The Archive of Bertrand Goldberg, gifted by his children through his estate","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Barrow, Heather and Lori Hanna Boyer.

With an eye attuned to color and a belief in the power of aesthetics to effect change, he has made lush, beautiful photographs of often terrible subjects. He is perhaps best known for his <em>Desert Cantos</em>, an extensive and ongoing series exploring the splendors and horrors of the American desert—man-made floods and fires, military-scarred terrain, pits of dead animals, and sublime night skies. Like an epic poem, the series is divided into cantos, now numbering twenty-eight. Canto III, “The Flood,” focuses on the Salton Sea, a lake that was created by an engineering mistake at the beginning of the twentieth century. The lake was stocked with fish in the 1950s to promote tourism but became permanently flooded a few decades later, leaving odd and often ironic reminders of human folly poking out of the water; the fish (seen at the bottom right of the picture) experience summer die-off due to the warming of the salty water and choking algae blooms. With biblical overtones of the apocalypse, Misrach here expanded the landscape tradition from a depiction of the picturesque to an expression of political engagement.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Image: 46.1 × 59.9 cm (18 3/16 × 23 5/8 in.); 50.7 × 60.9 cm (20 × 24 in.); Paper: 50.8 × 61 cm (20 × 24 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":59.9,"width_in":23.5827,"height_cm":46.1,"height_in":18.1497,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":60.9,"width_in":23.9764,"height_cm":50.7,"height_in":19.9607,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":61,"width_in":24,"height_cm":50.8,"height_in":20,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Paper"}],"medium_display":"Chromogenic print from digital file","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Photography Gala Endowment","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":"19 of 25","publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":20,"fiscal_year":2008,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Richard Misrach","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":14.4521,"color":{"h":275,"l":62,"s":0,"percentage":0.49408677522556527,"population":2749},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Photograph","artwork_type_id":2,"department_title":"Photography and Media","department_id":"PC-12","artist_id":43768,"artist_title":"Richard Misrach","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[43768],"artist_titles":["Richard Misrach"],"category_ids":["PC-12","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Photography and Media","Essentials"],"term_titles":["paper (fiber product)","chromogenic processes","photograph","seas","21st Century","chromogenic color print","fish","death","landscapes","photography","color photography"],"style_id":"TM-12913","style_title":"21st Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12913"],"style_titles":["21st Century"],"classification_id":"TM-240","classification_title":"photograph","alt_classification_ids":["TM-558","TM-67"],"classification_ids":["TM-240","TM-558","TM-67"],"classification_titles":["photograph","chromogenic color print","photography"],"subject_id":"TM-12286","alt_subject_ids":["TM-9135","TM-12097","TM-8657"],"subject_ids":["TM-12286","TM-9135","TM-12097","TM-8657"],"subject_titles":["seas","fish","death","landscapes"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2982"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)"],"technique_id":"TM-12322","alt_technique_ids":["TM-13061"],"technique_ids":["TM-12322","TM-13061"],"technique_titles":["chromogenic processes","color photography"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"70cc5210-4692-0a89-9998-e6a3a8030018","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Dead Fish, Salton Sea, from the series \"Desert Cantos III: The Flood\"","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2007.225"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Dead Fish, Salton Sea, from the series \"Desert Cantos III: The Flood\""],"weight":2049,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-01-01T13:29:55-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T15:03:15-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:35-06:00"}

The nude woman anchoring the composition is flanked by three other individuals, whose cropped bodies extend across a single mattress.

As imitations of the originals, Gober’s works have an uncanny effect, triggering disquieting thoughts about the most commonplace aspects of daily life. At the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York in 1989, Gober constructed two three-sided rooms defined by temporary sheetrock walls. The room seen here was outfitted with wallpaper depicting alternating images of a sleeping white man and a lynched black man hanging from a tree. At the literal center of the installation, the figure of a bride is strongly conjured by a wedding dress supported by a welded steel armature. The delicate dress stands rigid and empty, waiting to be filled. Gober himself has speculated that the relationship between the bride and the sleeping man in the wallpaper is that of husband and wife. Eight hand-painted plaster bags of cat litter line the walls of the room. A material that absorbs or hides waste, the litter serves as a symbolic remedy for the figurative mess of the bride, groom, and murdered black man. More to the point, however, it speaks to the lasting obligations and intimacy of committed love. On the whole, the room—and the veiled story of the imaginary couple it contains—can be considered a meditation on gender, race, romance, and terrible violence in contemporary American life.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Approximately 800 square feet, installed.","dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Silk satin, muslin, linen, tulle, welded steel, hand-printed silkscreen on paper, cast hydrostone plaster, vinyl acrylic paint, ink, and graphite","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Stefan T.

Central to all his endeavors was a holistic understanding of the universe and a desire to use science and technology in a sustainable manner to better serve mankind and the planet. Fuller coined the term <em>dymaxion</em> to label his inventions that applied available technology to provide the greatest possible efficiency. In 1927 he began investigating designs that would revolutionize transportation. Fuller used existing automotive parts and boat and airplane technology to design the <em>Dymaxion Car</em>, which debuted to an awed public at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The aerodynamic bullet shape and lightweight aluminum chassis enabled the car to reach speeds of 120 miles per hour, and consumed thirty miles per gallon. The three-wheeled vehicle had exceptional maneuverability due to its rear-wheel drivetrain. Fuller refined the design in the 1940s, but a prototype proved prohibitively expensive to manufacture. Although considered too radical to mass-produce at the time, Fuller’s <em>Dymaxion Car</em> presaged many features considered standard in today’s automobiles.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"34.3 × 91 cm (13 1/2 × 35 13/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":91,"width_in":35.8125,"height_cm":34.3,"height_in":13.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Ink on tracing paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through Prior Gift of Three Oaks Wrecking Company","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":25,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":41.4541,"color":{"h":40,"l":68,"s":50,"percentage":1.8636448773178496,"population":5373},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Architectural Drawing","artwork_type_id":34,"department_title":"Architecture and Design","department_id":"PC-5","artist_id":34579,"artist_title":"Richard Buckminster Fuller","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[34579],"artist_titles":["Richard Buckminster Fuller"],"category_ids":["PC-5","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Architecture and Design","Essentials"],"term_titles":["presentation drawing","cars","paper (fiber product)","drawing (image-making)","20th Century","architectural drawing","diagrams","tracing paper","ink","Chicago","design","drawing","experimental","experimental design","illinois","industrial design","social","sustainable","sustainable design","technology","wheel"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-920","classification_title":"presentation drawing","alt_classification_ids":["TM-126"],"classification_ids":["TM-920","TM-126"],"classification_titles":["presentation drawing","architectural drawing"],"subject_id":"TM-12416","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12098","TM-12075","TM-12574","TM-13376","TM-14550","TM-14896","TM-13214","TM-14689","TM-14398","TM-14895","TM-14621","TM-13707","TM-14897"],"subject_ids":["TM-12416","TM-12098","TM-12075","TM-12574","TM-13376","TM-14550","TM-14896","TM-13214","TM-14689","TM-14398","TM-14895","TM-14621","TM-13707","TM-14897"],"subject_titles":["cars","diagrams","Chicago","design","drawing","experimental","experimental design","illinois","industrial design","social","sustainable","sustainable design","technology","wheel"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":["TM-3040","TM-2398"],"material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-3040","TM-2398"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)","tracing paper","ink"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3919"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"002345ea-dc19-31a9-a023-603a0b870f84","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Dymaxion Car, Section","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1990.167.1"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Dymaxion Car, Section"],"weight":374,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:19:22-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T16:00:39-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:38-06:00"}

Burnham reputedly exclaimed around the time he unveiled his <em>Plan of Chicago</em>, the first comprehensive metropolitan plan in the United States. Providing the vocabulary for Chicago architecture through the 1920s, the project was the legacy of Burnham, whose renown in large-scale city planning began when he was chief of construction for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. Commissioned by the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan was developed with the assistance of architect Edward H. Bennett, who elaborated parts of it after Burnham’s death in 1912 and was responsible for executing many of its recommendations. Emulating the grand classical design of European cities, Chicago was to become “a Paris by the Lake.” Features included the development of Chicago’s lakefront and Lake Shore Drive, the construction of Grant Park, and the transformation of Michigan Avenue into a premier commercial boulevard following the completion of the Michigan Avenue bridge. Eleven of the seventeen perspective views were rendered by Burnham’s frequent collaborator, the Beaux-Arts-trained Jules Guérin. The draftsman’s stunning, impressionistic views, with their unusual perspectives and dramatic use of color, bring the <em>Plan of Chicago</em> to life, imbuing it, as Burnham stated about his own aims, with the “magic to stir men’s blood.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"103.5 × 480 cm (40 3/4 × 189 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":480,"width_in":189,"height_cm":103.5,"height_in":40.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Watercolor and graphite on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"On permanent loan to The Art Institute of Chicago from the City of Chicago","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":25,"fiscal_year":null,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":26.964,"color":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Architectural Drawing","artwork_type_id":34,"department_title":"Architecture and Design","department_id":"PC-5","artist_id":50668,"artist_title":"Daniel Hudson Burnham","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[50668],"artist_titles":["Daniel Hudson Burnham"],"category_ids":["PC-5","PC-831"],"category_titles":["Architecture and Design","Essentials"],"term_titles":["20th Century","paper","Chicago","graphite","drawing (image-making)","architecture","watercolor","paper (fiber product)","watercolor","architectural drawing","architectural drawing","drawing","harbor","horizon","illinois","lake","park","pier","plan","shore"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-145","classification_title":"paper","alt_classification_ids":["TM-39","TM-126"],"classification_ids":["TM-145","TM-39","TM-126"],"classification_titles":["paper","watercolor","architectural drawing"],"subject_id":"TM-12075","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12085","TM-14668","TM-13376","TM-14899","TM-14902","TM-13214","TM-14517","TM-14898","TM-14900","TM-13332","TM-14901"],"subject_ids":["TM-12075","TM-12085","TM-14668","TM-13376","TM-14899","TM-14902","TM-13214","TM-14517","TM-14898","TM-14900","TM-13332","TM-14901"],"subject_titles":["Chicago","architecture","architectural drawing","drawing","harbor","horizon","illinois","lake","park","pier","plan","shore"],"material_id":"TM-2410","alt_material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-2403"],"material_ids":["TM-2410","TM-2982","TM-2403"],"material_titles":["graphite","paper (fiber product)","watercolor"],"technique_id":"TM-3919","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3919"],"technique_titles":["drawing (image-making)"],"theme_titles":["Essentials"],"image_id":"db2379de-daa1-6def-087b-c1e9d8185531","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Plate 49 from Plan of Chicago 1909: Chicago.

It was painted by the Chicago Surrealist Gertrude Abercrombie but seems to lack the mysterious imagery of her landscapes and interior scenes. Further examination, however, reveals subtle touches of her dark aesthetic, beginning with the title itself. <em>Self-Portrait of My Sister</em> is an enigmatic reference to a sister who did not exist, for the artist was in fact an only child. However, Abercrombie initially referred to this painting as “Portrait of Artist as Ideal,” a phrase that reveals her underlying meaning. Abercrombie’s work was invariably self-referential; as she put it, “It’s always myself that I paint, but not actually, because I don’t look that good or cute.” Her reference to a fictitious, prettier sister hints at her desire to be a different person, a longing she satisfied through self-portraiture.</p>\n<p>Here, the artist exaggerated and idealized her appearance, depicting herself with an extraordinarily long, slender neck; vivid blue eyes; and sharpened features. She portrayed herself wearing black gloves and a flat-brimmed hat trimmed with a bunch of grapes, all motifs that recurred with some frequency in her paintings and acted as symbols of her presence. Such inclusions helped shape her individual variant of Surrealism, which she felt was based in realism. “Surrealism is meant for me,” she remarked, “because I am a pretty realistic person but don’t like all I see. So I dream that it is changed. Then I change it to the way I want it. It is almost always pretty real. Only mystery and fantasy have been added. All foolishness has been taken out. It becomes my own dream.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"68.6 × 55.9 cm (27 × 22 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":55.9,"width_in":22,"height_cm":68.6,"height_in":27,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Powell and Barbara Bridges","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"<em>Annual Report</em> (Art Institute of Chicago, 2008–09), 16.\n\n<em>Paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago: Highlights of the Collection</em>, (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago/Yale University Press, 2017) 133.","exhibition_history":"Art Institute of Chicago, <em>52nd Annual Exhibition of American Paintings and Sculpture</em>, Oct. 30, 1941–Jan. 4, 1942, cat. 1.\n\nNew York, Associated American Artist Galleries, <em>First Exhibition of Paintings by Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, Jan. 24–Feb. 6, 1949, cat. 9.\n\nAthens, Ohio University, 1947.\n\nChicago Public Library, <em>Art Room</em>, 1948.\n\nChicago, Mandel Brothers Gallery, <em>Exhibition of Chicago Artists' Self Portraits</em>, 1953.\n\nChicago, Newman Brown Gallery, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1953.\n\nAurora, Illinois, John Fordon Gallery, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1953.\n\nChicago, Hyde Park Art Center, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie: a Retrospective Exhibition</em>, 1977, as <em>Self–Portrait</em>, cat. 25.\n\nChicago and Springfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1991.\n\nChicago and Springfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Chicago Painting, 1895–1945, the Bridges Collection</em>, 2000–01, cat. 1.\n\nChicago, Terra Museum of American Art, <em>Chicago Modern, 1893–1945: Pursuit of the New</em>, July 17–Oct. 31, 2004, cat. 1.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, Elvehjem Museum of Art, <em>With Friends–Six Magic Realists</em>, June 18–Aug. 28, 2005.\n\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, <em>Art In Chicago – Resisting Regionalism, Transforming Modernsim</em>, Feb. 9–Apr. 2, 2006, cat. 17.\n\nSpringfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Chicago Painting, 1895–1945, the Bridges Collection</em>, 2007–08.\n\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art, <em>In Wonderland: The Surrealist Activities of Women Artists in Mexico and the United States</em>, Jan. 29–May 6, 2012; Musee National des Beaux–Arts du Quebec, June 7–Sept. 3, 2012; Mexico City, Museo de Arte Moderno, Sept. 27, 2012–Jan. 13, 2013, cat. 24.\n\nChicago, Newberry Library, <em>Chicago Avant-Garde</em>, Sept. 10–Dec. 30, 2021, cat.

By the 1970s she began to insert meticulous trompe l’oeil elements as well, including metal rulers and masking tape painted along the borders of her images. The artist has explained that the painted rulers measured or marked the physical dimensions of a work’s edge, while the painted floors measured or marked illusionistic space. In Mangold’s words, “The works of this period were like catalogues of these different realities in painting.”</p>\n<p>In their constant reappraisal of the relationship between painting and picture, and in their frequent recourse to the grid-like structures of flooring, Mangold’s works can operate like rigorous abstractions, aligned with Minimal and Conceptual practices of the time. Yet they often derive their affect from more subjective, even personal content as well. For instance, the ruler in this painting, which stops on the right edge of the canvas at 66 ¾ inches, serves as an intimate tribute, corresponding to the age of the artist’s father at his death. This is the only work in her oeuvre that offers such an overtly biographical, memorializing reference. The green linoleum floor, which is also exclusive to this work, was inspired by a small section of old flooring the artist discovered in her basement. Here Mangold painted, with her customary precision, an imagined reconstruction as opposed to an observed reality.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"76.5 × 183 cm (30 × 72 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":183,"width_in":72,"height_cm":76.5,"height_in":30,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Adeline Yates","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2009,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Sylvia Plimack Mangold.","has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":23.1148,"color":{"h":107,"l":57,"s":17,"percentage":2.18998083766767,"population":6480},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":61535,"artist_title":"Sylvia Plimack Mangold","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[61535],"artist_titles":["Sylvia Plimack Mangold"],"category_ids":["PC-825","PC-8"],"category_titles":["Women artists","Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting (image making)","acrylic paint","grids","acrylic paintings (visual works)","canvas","squares","green (color)","rulers (people)","painting"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-10368","classification_title":"acrylic paintings (visual works)","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-10368","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["acrylic paintings (visual works)","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12518","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12654","TM-11849","TM-12865"],"subject_ids":["TM-12518","TM-12654","TM-11849","TM-12865"],"subject_titles":["grids","squares","green (color)","rulers (people)"],"material_id":"TM-2407","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2407","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["acrylic paint","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Women artists"],"image_id":"a947ecd5-93aa-93d4-4a4d-3aca15a30857","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["986ce7ec-ce39-fd71-2ea4-ee29920f1a28"],"sound_ids":["986ce7ec-ce39-fd71-2ea4-ee29920f1a28"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"In Memory of My Father","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2009.52"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["In Memory of My Father"],"weight":2434,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-15T14:19:47-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:27:38-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:43-06:00"}

The powerful Nur Jahan had immense financial resources at her disposal. Built between 1622 and 1628 and modest in size, as befitted the mausoleum of a nobleman rather than an emperor, the structure is lavish in its use of semiprecious stones, and the workmanship and design are of unsurpassed quality. In its exclusive use of white marble, it antedates the Taj Mahal and is considered by many to be the finer monument.</p>\n<p>This drawing was created in the Company style, named after the British East India Company, which spearheaded English mercantile and political interests in the subcontinent from the early seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. The British were eager to record and catalogue everything they saw. In the absence of photography, first British and later Indian artists, who excelled in drawing and painting fine details, recorded the sights.

In this monumental portrait, therefore, we are looking not only at an unusual subject matter but also at a study of an extraordinary simian: one with human features complete with a beard, pale eyes, and long, slender hands. The inscription on the back of this work, written in Devanagari, states that the monkey is named Husaini and “comes from” Nawab Davad (or Daud) Khan. This name most likely refers to Daud Khan Panni, a powerful nobleman and a <em>faujdar</em> (a military commander and territorial administrator) who served the Mughal emperors from Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) through Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713–19), in various parts of India. The painting has been dated to 1705/10 and is attributed to the anonymous artist now called the Stipple Master. Working in tandem with his patron Maharana Amar Singh II of Mewar (r. 1698–1710), this artist was the initiator of a new painting style in Mewar in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. A group of about forty-six paintings, including the present work, has now been attributed to this artist-patron duo.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"Outermost border: 48.5 × 58.7 cm (19 × 23 in.); Image: 45 × 56 cm (17 3/4 × 22 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":58.7,"width_in":23,"height_cm":48.5,"height_in":19,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Outermost border"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":56,"width_in":22,"height_cm":45,"height_in":17.7,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image"}],"medium_display":"Opaque watercolor and gold on paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Lacy Armour Fund, James and Marilynn Alsdorf Acquisition Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":8,"fiscal_year":2011,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":true,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":-1,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":44.1119,"color":{"h":1,"l":52,"s":59,"percentage":0.012031859006947976,"population":71},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Arts of Asia","department_id":"PC-7","artist_id":null,"artist_title":null,"alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[],"artist_titles":[],"category_ids":["PC-7","PC-837"],"category_titles":["Arts of Asia","Arts of Asia 100"],"term_titles":["paper (fiber product)","painting (image making)","monkeys","asian art","South Asian","gold","watercolor","animals","watercolor","painting"],"style_id":"TM-5344","style_title":"South Asian","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-5344"],"style_titles":["South Asian"],"classification_id":"TM-26","classification_title":"asian art","alt_classification_ids":["TM-39","TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-26","TM-39","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["asian art","watercolor","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-9125","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12218"],"subject_ids":["TM-9125","TM-12218"],"subject_titles":["monkeys","animals"],"material_id":"TM-2982","alt_material_ids":["TM-2452","TM-2403"],"material_ids":["TM-2982","TM-2452","TM-2403"],"material_titles":["paper (fiber product)","gold","watercolor"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Arts of Asia 100"],"image_id":"67c7274f-612f-3180-0a12-e2c7ed5a7dd4","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"A Monumental Portrait of a Monkey","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2011.248"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["A Monumental Portrait of a Monkey"],"weight":3452,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:19:27-05:00","updated_at":"2023-04-07T15:37:16-05:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:47-06:00"}

Cotton sharecropping, a system of tenant farming that developed after the Civil War, allowed landowners to rent land to poor farmers in return for a portion of the crops. Because the practice kept agricultural workers impoverished, it became a symbol of a racially and economically unjust system. Benton’s vision of modernism was firmly rooted in figuration.

During the second half of the decade, Whitten began working toward an entirely unique relationship to painting that he described in this way: “About 1965 I wrote on my studio wall one day, the image is photographic; I must photograph my thoughts.” By 1970 the artist had eliminated both expressive color and figuration from his work, launching a ten-year series of paintings that capture, like a camera, the often chance-based immediacies of his dynamic studio process.</p>\n<p><em>Khee II</em> exhibits all the hallmarks of Whitten’s mature process-derived paintings. As with other works from this period, the artist placed a variety of flat, shaped objects beneath the canvas. After preparing the surface with gesso, he layered it with thin sheets of colored Japanese rice paper. The rice paper dissolved, leaving behind pure pigment. Whitten then pulled a rake or other notched tool—which he calls a “developer,” in obvious reference to a photographer’s chemicals—across the work’s surface. This served both to impress the shapes from below, effectively embossing the canvas, and to disperse color on top of it. The result is a series of ghostlike images and alternating rows of color that vibrate with subtle luminosity. This is a glowing evocative abstract painting that is also a layer-by-layer document of its own making.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"182.9 × 213.4 cm (72 × 84 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":213.4,"width_in":84,"height_cm":182.9,"height_in":72,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Contemporary Art Discretionary Fund; through prior purchase with funds provided by Mr. and Mrs. Solomon B.

Gutai (“concreteness” in Japanese) was formed in 1954 and swiftly became postwar Japan’s most significant avant-garde collective. In its manifesto the group advocated for an exuberant, ethically invested freedom of expression: “Gutai Art imparts life to matter.”</p>\n<p>Shiraga once described the world as a “splendid playground.” He sought an unmediated form of painting, soon abandoning the traditional brush in order to paint with his feet, swinging himself from ropes over sheets of paper placed on the floor. The earliest of these pioneering works were made as part of live performances, but from 1959 Shiraga continued his practice on canvas and within his studio. This 1960 painting demonstrates the range of simultaneously sensuous and dynamic effects the artist could achieve through his singular method — slick, muscular smears of brighter and darker reds and oranges contrast with vigorous insertions of deep blue as well as with a fringe of more atmospheric stains of color. The title refers to the celebrated fourteenth-century Chinese novel <em>Shuihu zhuan (Water Margin)</em>, which follows the feats of outlaw Song Jiang and his band of accomplices.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"130 × 195 cm (51 1/8 × 76 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":195,"width_in":76.75,"height_cm":130,"height_in":51.125,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior purchase from the Mary and Leigh Block Fund, purchased with funds provided by Barbara Bluhm-Kaul and Don Kaul.","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2014,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":66.0889,"color":{"h":0,"l":37,"s":60,"percentage":0.6201560135642099,"population":2959},"latitude":41.880588939651,"longitude":-87.621412632176,"latlon":"41.880588939651,41.880588939651","is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 294","gallery_id":23975,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":112971,"artist_title":"Kazuo Shiraga","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[112971],"artist_titles":["Kazuo Shiraga"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-836"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Contemporary works by BIPOC artists, summer 2021"],"term_titles":["Gutai group","oil painting","oil paint (paint)","red (color)","painting","oil paintings (visual works)","painting (image making)","canvas","blue (color)","orange (color)","contemporary"],"style_id":"TM-13467","style_title":"Gutai group","alt_style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_ids":["TM-13467","TM-12062"],"style_titles":["Gutai group","contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":["TM-78"],"classification_ids":["TM-9","TM-78"],"classification_titles":["painting","oil paintings (visual works)"],"subject_id":"TM-11851","alt_subject_ids":["TM-11843","TM-11905"],"subject_ids":["TM-11851","TM-11843","TM-11905"],"subject_titles":["red (color)","blue (color)","orange (color)"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Contemporary works by BIPOC artists, summer 2021"],"image_id":"6975aec8-1d8b-707d-5250-f329dc2210b6","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["dd9fbf6c-126a-201d-9462-245fbe34e117"],"sound_ids":["dd9fbf6c-126a-201d-9462-245fbe34e117"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Golden Wings Brushing the Clouds Incarnated from Earthly Wide Star (Chikatsusei Maunkinshi)","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2013.1092"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Golden Wings Brushing the Clouds Incarnated from Earthly Wide Star (Chikatsusei Maunkinshi)"],"weight":7922,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-03-31T11:32:46-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T14:36:41-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:52-06:00"}

The artist’s desire to move away from the restrictive binary of Hindu–Muslim conflict led her to focus instead on the cosmopolitanism of the Silk Road, the series of trade routes that linked Kashmir to Central Asia, China, and Europe in antiquity. This historical perspective is reflected in Sheikh’s imagery and in the use of the painted scroll format. Suspended from the ceiling so as to be visible from both sides, the works capture the composite culture of the Kashmir Valley through palimpsestic episodes, layering richly colored passages of figuration and script.</p>\n<p><em>We Must Bear</em>, which Sheikh painted specifically for a solo exhibition at the Art Institute, comments not only on the troubles that have beset the Kashmir Valley since 1989, but also on the ongoing hardships its residents have borne over the centuries. The work is based on a quotation from a sixteenth-century verse by Nund Rishi (Sheikh Nuruddin Nurani), which can be seen at upper left.

Although trained as a painter, as early as the 1930s Saitō began a series of controversial plywood reliefs that were difficult to classify as either painting or sculpture, as those conventional categories were understood at the time. Much of his work was then lost or destroyed during World War II, but Saitō gradually made his way back to the wall-relief format, producing his best-known and intensely physical works—the painted, gouged, and drilled wood panels of the 1960s.</p>\n<p>“The ideal is a painting surface that can stand up to the real, concrete colors that have quality and strength,” Saitō once said, insisting that paintings themselves must be understood to—or must be made to—“solidly exist.” In 1960 he first used a power drill to scar the surface of his works; the small circular depressions in this relief were produced by the carefully controlled pressure of such a drill, at once an act of aggression against the previously flat surface of the panel and also a gesture of decoration or elaboration.

I pull down what I need to create my collages. . . . Like those tagged up, repainted, tagged up, sanded, and repainted walls you pass everyday on the street, my process is both reductive and additive.” Bradford is also known for redeploying hair dye and wave endpapers from his mother’s salon, where he worked on and off for many years, and more recently for using home-repair caulking to amplify ridges and depths. It is usually impossible to recognize such individual materials on his surfaces; the power of Bradford’s work is the power of cumulative materiality, at once enigmatic and evocative.</p>\n<p>The sweeping composition of <em>A Siren beside a Ship</em> is built up from a mix of carbon paper, caulking, and acrylic gel medium that Bradford relentlessly layered, sanded, and layered again to create a dense, suggestive texture.

His paintings combine African motifs, Islamic calligraphy, and Euro-American modernism. A member of the revolutionary Khartoum school, El-Salahi contributed to the intellectual climate of postcolonial Sudan and the making of a national art and aesthetic in the 1960s. His work is characterized by the use of earthy colors, the transformation of Arabic letters into abstracted forms, and the merging of folk art with modern abstract painting. The artist once described the “Pandora’s box” of animal, plant, and, more specifically, skeletal and masked forms that seemed to open for him as he deconstructed and abstracted the shapes of written language; he was also inspired by the structure of West African masks.</p>\n<p>A radically abstracted figure—holding a pomegranate in its right hand—plays a prominent role in <em>Male-Female Figure and the Pomegranate</em>. Just as striking, however, is the material surface of the work, with its array of intricate textures. This painting exemplifies the artist’s innovations of the 1960s both in its compositional complexity and its evident engagement with process. El-Salahi used enamel and oil paint as well as a technique he called “tickling,” which involved manipulating the canvas with his fingers to create the appearance of depth. Discussing this painting, he has said, “I did it in Sudan, at a time when I was focusing on . . . somber relations. I started by building the image with a mixture of white oil and enamel paints, then treated it with a glaze of burnt sienna and black oil paints mixed with linseed oil. I used an old canvas, which after some time I had rolled so that the paint would crack, because that was the effect I wanted.”</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"92.5 × 92.5 cm (36 1/4 × 36 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92.5,"width_in":36.25,"height_cm":92.5,"height_in":36.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior purchase from the Mary and Leigh Block Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2015,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 1968 Ibrahim El-Salahi","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":46.6264,"color":{"h":32,"l":69,"s":84,"percentage":0.007325945399165406,"population":52},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":57231,"artist_title":"Ibrahim El-Salahi","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[57231],"artist_titles":["Ibrahim El-Salahi"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["figures (representations)","oil painting","oil paint (paint)","painting","contemporary","painting (image making)","canvas","pomegranates"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12283","alt_subject_ids":["TM-11999"],"subject_ids":["TM-12283","TM-11999"],"subject_titles":["figures (representations)","pomegranates"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"c64c4cc8-ca3a-c22e-0bbd-5ac3a26d8c0f","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Male-Female Figure with Pomegranate","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2015.84"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Male-Female Figure with Pomegranate"],"weight":344,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-13T16:47:34-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:26:21-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:46:57-06:00"}

He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming <em>Cleopatra</em> (1963). <em>Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz]</em> comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar. This garish use of “makeup” is meant to suggest style and glamor, reinforcing Taylor’s celebrity status.</p>\n","short_description":"No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol.

Self-trained, he began his career as a key member of the No Name Art Group, which was the most significant clandestine artists’ group formed in the early 1970s. After leaving its ranks in 1979, Zhang became one of the first artists in the country to make abstract paintings following the Cultural Revolution. His approach to abstraction is grounded in his knowledge of traditional Chinese ink painting, in which an emphasis is placed on expressing emotion through the gestural movement of the brush.</p>\n<p><em>AC10</em> depicts two glowing amorphous turquoise forms on a raw linen plane. The color is at once translucent and delicately built up. Zhang was interested in producing an allover composition in which the viewer cannot identify where that artist had begun or ended his mark making. He has discussed this particular painting with reference to power and art, remarking, “The big blue painting that I painted in 1984—the one I love so much! . . . I borrowed that [concept of power] from the Chinese traditional mentality. There is this Chinese saying, ‘power is formless.’ That’s my language too.” Formless power is an apt description of the whole of Zhang’s practice; from his first painting, his art has always been subversive. He worked always outside of China’s official arts institutions, first as part of the No Name Art Group and later when he used his apartment as a makeshift salon and art gallery. In so doing, he became influential within the underground art movement of the early 1980s.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"180 × 312 cm (70 7/8 × 122 7/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":312,"width_in":122.875,"height_cm":180,"height_in":70.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on linen; 2 panels","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior purchase from the Mary and Leigh Block Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2015,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Zhang Wei / Boers-Li Gallery","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":19.9129,"color":{"h":189,"l":54,"s":17,"percentage":0.3056282658353186,"population":1247},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":114412,"artist_title":"Wei Zhang","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[114412],"artist_titles":["Wei Zhang"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["oil painting","oil paint (paint)","blue (color)","painting","contemporary","painting (image making)","linen (material)","abstract shapes"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":"TM-11843","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12708"],"subject_ids":["TM-11843","TM-12708"],"subject_titles":["blue (color)","abstract shapes"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":["TM-3093"],"material_ids":["TM-2451","TM-3093"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)","linen (material)"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"df1620f2-8309-d1aa-1914-50cb737b662f","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"AC10","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2015.178a-b"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["AC10"],"weight":398,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-12-14T16:04:33-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:26:52-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:47:02-06:00"}

Many of the former have transpired unceremoniously in incidental public spaces such as parks, sidewalks, and gutters, with the artist donning variously symbolic attire — a skirt made of dollar bills and a sausage-link chain for <em>ATM Piece</em> (1997) and a capeless Superman costume for the ongoing <em>Great White Way</em>. Readily identifiable themes in Pope.L’s art include the disruption of conventions of cultural identity, the paradoxical idea of lack as a source of value, and the explosion of traditional artistic categories. He applies the term <em>drawing</em> liberally, for instance, stressing the impulses that make drawing necessary and the way in which tactile engagement with a given surface, form, or space can be considered an act of drawing. This work places a similar emphasis on the category of painting.</p>\n<p>The title <em>Finnish Painting</em> proposes a strangely specific, yet also enigmatic, evocation of national identity and offers a play on words by referencing the imperative to “finish painting.” The surface is materially and formally riotous, comprised of the barely legible text of a poem whose last word is “decode”—as if acknowledging that to see, read, and understand others is always a struggle and that meaning is often fluid or open-ended. Meanwhile, the painting’s clearest feature is the signature-like name of artist Robert Ryman in the bottom right corner. Ryman, a figure associated with the emergence of Minimalism in the early 1960s, treated his signature as an important visual element within a painting’s composition, never simply as authorization of a finished canvas. Ryman is also known for a signature color (or noncolor): he makes white monochrome paintings, although sometimes the white has been layered on top of colorful, mostly or entirely obscured underpainting. Perhaps this Pope.L work reveals what might lie beneath Ryman's white surfaces.</p>\n","short_description":"Pope.L is known for groundbreaking performances as well as text-based drawings and paintings that disrupt the conventions of cultural identity and explode traditional artistic categories.

One of today’s leading Chinese artists, Tai is part of a generation that is working to reinvigorate tradition by embracing new ideas and techniques. Although fluent in styles of classical painting and calligraphy, he has in recent years developed an original approach that imbues traditional materials—brush, ink, paper, and silk—with a combination of highly expressive brushwork, abstraction, and monumental scale.</p>\n<p>This painting embodies the basic ideas of Chinese cosmology, which views the world as a complete and complex organism in which the intrinsic nature of things is to move and change. Within this cyclical universe, humans are able to discern consistent patterns by observing the seasons and celestial realms, practicing dream divination, and manipulating the hexagrams of the <em>I Ching</em>. In this work, Tai captures that principle movement—atmospheric forces clashing and meteorites surging through mist and clouds—and organically merges the classical conception of the cosmos with his distinctively expressive style. The result is spontaneous, mysterious, but above all, beautiful.</p>\n<p>A scholar of art history and theory, Tai has asserted that “to present landscape painting that meets modern tastes, we must start from the experience of modern society—by properly accessing the living spirit of art, researching the materials, techniques, medium, and modern time-space experience.

Considered representative of the Korean Tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Chung’s works are thus defined not by any single choice of color but instead by how they were made. Indeed, many products of the movement were referred to as <em>pangbop</em>—“methods” — rather than as paintings; the centrality of method or process led Korean art critic Yi Kyung-Sung to describe Tansaekhwa works in terms of drawing with, spreading, bleeding, spilling, and pushing paint, for instance.</p>\n<p><em>Untitled, 72-12-A</em> is one of Chung’s key transitional works, among the first in which he initially employed uniform, allover applications of paint before then peeling and scraping some of it away. The resulting canvas was then covered from edge to edge by two different kinds of marks: those that remain from the first white coats and the similarly sized “strokes” made by pulling paint away. These latter gestures sometimes expose the loosely woven brown canvas support and at other times reveal underlayers of different white paints—some matte, some shiny, some off-white, and some faintly yellow. The large scale of this simultaneously random and exacting composition raises issues of labor, intensity, and intention. At the same time, the very idea of a composition is thrown into question: Chung filled his canvas evenly and without emphasis, often shifting it as he worked in order to ensure a kind of noncompositional unity across the entire field of the painting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"162 × 130 cm (63 13/16 × 51 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":130,"width_in":51.2,"height_cm":162,"height_in":63.8,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior purchase from the Mary and Leigh Block Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2016,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":17.2395,"color":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":114644,"artist_title":"Chung, Sang-Hwa","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[114644],"artist_titles":["Chung, Sang-Hwa"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting (image making)","acrylic paint","patterns","acrylic paintings (visual works)","Tansaekhwa","canvas","painting","Dansaekhwa"],"style_id":"TM-14786","style_title":"Tansaekhwa","alt_style_ids":["TM-14787"],"style_ids":["TM-14786","TM-14787"],"style_titles":["Tansaekhwa","Dansaekhwa"],"classification_id":"TM-10368","classification_title":"acrylic paintings (visual works)","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-10368","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["acrylic paintings (visual works)","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12793","alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":["TM-12793"],"subject_titles":["patterns"],"material_id":"TM-2407","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2407","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["acrylic paint","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"86f8596f-6fc2-5f28-dc26-8526b5da2290","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Untitled 72–12–A","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2016.62"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Untitled 72–12–A"],"weight":264,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-03T23:32:25-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:28:46-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:47:06-06:00"}

This was a Pop Art–inflected turn to representational painting as a form of sardonic commentary on and resistance to a number of forces—a dictatorial government, the rise of consumer culture in parallel with a rise in urban poverty, and, in Pimentel’s case specifically, the stereotypes and constraints imposed on women by a patriarchal society.</p>\n<p>Pimentel began her decade-long <em>Involvement Series</em> around 1965; as she put it a few years later, “My studio is in my bedroom. Everything has to be very neat. . . . I work alone. I think my issues are the issues of our time: the lack of perspective for people, their alienation. The saddest thing is for people to be dominated by things.” Rendered in a vivid but reduced palette and a flat, graphic style, these early works hint at intimate, mundane scenes. They depict domestic objects in enigmatic, compressed interiors and suggest acts of corresponding domestic labor, always implying—if not always representing—a woman’s body. When pictured, this body is fragmented—a leg or a pair of feet rather than a fully legible form. In this 1968 canvas, for example, a pair of feet peek out from below the horizon-like line of a red ironing board. The owner of these feet is otherwise only indicated by a rack of blouses and by the ready iron: the trappings of stereotyped female labor and identity.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"130 × 98 cm (51 1/4 × 38 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":98,"width_in":38.6,"height_cm":130,"height_in":51.2,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Vinyl on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior purchase from the Mary and Leigh Block Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2016,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":100.6465,"color":{"h":5,"l":36,"s":97,"percentage":0.29456886686870465,"population":2811},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":114672,"artist_title":"Wanda Pimentel","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[114672],"artist_titles":["Wanda Pimentel"],"category_ids":["PC-8","PC-825"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art","Women artists"],"term_titles":["synthetic resin paint","clothing","painting","contemporary","vinyl","canvas","irons (tools)","red (color)","blue (color)","white (color)","black (color)"],"style_id":"TM-12062","style_title":"contemporary","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12062"],"style_titles":["contemporary"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":"TM-13438","alt_subject_ids":["TM-13439","TM-11851","TM-11843","TM-11841","TM-11845"],"subject_ids":["TM-13438","TM-13439","TM-11851","TM-11843","TM-11841","TM-11845"],"subject_titles":["clothing","irons (tools)","red (color)","blue (color)","white (color)","black (color)"],"material_id":"TM-13387","alt_material_ids":["TM-11764","TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-13387","TM-11764","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["synthetic resin paint","vinyl","canvas"],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":["Women artists"],"image_id":"0f6ffedf-d080-9528-9543-31087899ce57","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Involvement Series","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2016.66"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Involvement Series"],"weight":1528,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-03T16:12:09-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-19T23:23:22-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:47:07-06:00"}

In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian Giorgio Vasari stated that “first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.”</p>\n<p><em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"118 × 92 cm (46 7/16 × 36 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92,"width_in":36.25,"height_cm":118,"height_in":46.4375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Lacy Armour, Ada Turnbull Hertle, Mary Swissler Oldberg Acquisition, Charles H. and Mary F.

They felt that the ills of society were best exposed through the meticulously painted realism, which evoked Germany’s past. Combining historical style with images of the nation’s present-day situation, Scholz’s paintings offer a biting critique of the new Weimar Republic’s political and social shortcomings.</p>\n<p><em>Small Town by Day</em> is a case in point. At the top of the canvas we are reminded of the mythic ideals of Germany: faith (a priest and the cross of a church illuminated by the sky), family (the woman pushing the carriage and a group of geese walking in an orderly line), the country’s great heritage (the bust of Frederick the Great), and national symbols (an inn called the German Oak). Further down, however, a cold clarity reveals the inner workings of a fictional town in the region of Baden. Nestled within the cozy buildings and streets, we see a cast of characters and the hypocrisy they represent. A puffed-up officer in uniform walks proudly while a wounded vet hobbles in the other direction, a bloated butcher squeezes clean the intestines of a pig as he holds a bloody knife in his mouth, a young boy scoops manure from a horse-drawn hearse, and an elderly woman walks to an outhouse. Scholz’s clear vision lays bare the base and at times sordid activities of a seemingly idyllic setting.</p>\n","short_description":null,"dimensions":"99.7 × 74.3 cm (39 1/4 × 29 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":74.3,"width_in":29.25,"height_cm":99.7,"height_in":39.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on board","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2016,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":44.1496,"color":{"h":184,"l":30,"s":51,"percentage":0.018933806992328148,"population":181},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 392","gallery_id":25475,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Modern Art","department_id":"PC-11","artist_id":57509,"artist_title":"Georg Scholz","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[57509],"artist_titles":["Georg Scholz"],"category_ids":["PC-11"],"category_titles":["Modern Art"],"term_titles":["oil painting","oil paint (paint)","towns","painting","Modernism","painting (image making)","animals","horses","birds"],"style_id":"TM-5981","style_title":"Modernism","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-5981"],"style_titles":["Modernism"],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12677","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12218","TM-8804","TM-11211"],"subject_ids":["TM-12677","TM-12218","TM-8804","TM-11211"],"subject_titles":["towns","animals","horses","birds"],"material_id":"TM-2451","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-2451"],"material_titles":["oil paint (paint)"],"technique_id":"TM-4273","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_ids":["TM-4273","TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["oil painting","painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"cd773e50-2f0f-9d5d-e112-a5271164abf2","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Small Town by Day (Badische Kleinstadt bei Tage)","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2016.46"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Small Town by Day (Badische Kleinstadt bei Tage)"],"weight":2303,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-10-20T18:02:00-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-18T12:35:09-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:47:10-06:00"}

Taken out of context, repositioned, and signed by the artist, the readymade upended tradition and artistic convention by revolutionizing the way we think about what an artwork is, how it is produced, and the ways in which it is exhibited.</p>\n<p>In 1914 Duchamp purchased this mass-produced bottle rack at a department store. He felt free to acquire new versions for exhibitions and display after his sister accidentally discarded the “original.” He selected the present version for the 1959 exhibition <em>Art and the Found Object in New York</em>. Artist Robert Rauschenberg acquired <em>Bottle Rack</em> and asked Duchamp to sign it.
