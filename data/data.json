Watermills, which Hobbema employed more than 30 times in his paintings and which abounded along country waterways, would have been understood as symbols of human transience and Dutch industriousness. The well-dressed figures farther along the path at the left are intended to suggest the rewards of productivity and diligence.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Realism","placeOfOrigin":"Holland","depicts":"Century of Progress,landscapes,world's fairs,Chicago World's Fairs","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/237c25a2-6051-a8e7-1610-a01938d4deab/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/237c25a2-6051-a8e7-1610-a01938d4deab/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1662/65","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"81.3 Ã— 110 cm "}]
