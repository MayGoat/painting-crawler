But critics and the public did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects; they called him the “apostle of ugliness.”</p>\n<p>The ample, demurely dressed subject of <em>Mère Grégoire</em> was inspired by the heroine of a popular song written in the 1820s by French lyricist Pierre-Jean Béranger. Béranger often penned ribald lyrics; his “Madame Grégoire” was the proprietor of a house of prostitution. Courbet depicted the woman here in the midst of a transaction, with coins scattered on a marble-topped counter and a ledger beneath her right hand. Under her other hand is the small bell she uses to summon one of her female employees. She presumably offers an unseen customer a flower, a symbol of love.</p>\n<p>The painting may also have had a political subtext. Béranger and Courbet were fierce opponents of the monarchy and the Second Empire, respectively. In the mid-1850s, when Courbet began his portrait of Mère Grégoire, the government harshly attacked the songs of the popular writer as part of an effort to restrict free expression. Courbet’s decision to portray Béranger’s Madame Grégoire, whose flower exhibits the blue, white, and red of the French flag, may represent a protest not only against government censorship but also against the Second Empire itself, making the subject of this painting into a heroine embodying the rights to freedom in life and love that were forbidden under a repressive regime.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"","placeOfOrigin":"France","depicts":"Century of Progress,portraits,world's fairs,Chicago World's Fairs","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/2e6d08c8-dac0-4f1c-3e56-de3539ceb905/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/2e6d08c8-dac0-4f1c-3e56-de3539ceb905/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1855 and 1857/59","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"129 × 97.5 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"1956.1109","artist":"Jan Sanders van Hemessen","title":"Judith","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>Judith was considered one of the most heroic women of the Old Testament.

After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head.</p>\n<p>Van Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag. The interplay between the straining pose of the figure, the dramatic lighting, and the fastidiously recorded surfaces serves to heighten the tension of this composition.</p>\n","shortDesc":"According to the biblical story, the widow Judith saved her people from slaughter by the Assyrian army by infiltrating the tent of the enemy general, Holofernes, to seduce and then behead him.

He had studied at China’s most progressive art academy, training in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting and calligraphy. Despite his education, Zao’s arrival in the cosmopolitan French capital prompted for him a more tangible, as well as conceptual, reckoning with Eastern and Western aesthetics. However, it was not until he traveled to the United States, where he viewed Abstract Expressionist paintings for the first time, did the artist embrace exclusively the atmospheric abstraction for which he became known. After returning to Paris, Zao began to create sweeping, large-scale compositions and swiftly rose to prominence among a circle of fellow Paris-based abstract painters interested in lyrical and intuitive mark making, including American Joan Mitchell and German-born Hans Hartung.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Night is Stirring</em>, Zao built up layers of jewel-toned color, activated by touches of lurid red and a torquing column that seems to climb up the center of the canvas. While his dark, inky brushstrokes call to mind Chinese calligraphy, still more traditional Chinese painting is reflected through Zao’s manipulation of the tropes of the landscape format, which emphasizes the rhythms<br>and energies of nature more than a strictly realistic approach.

Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional.

Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for <em>Beata Beatrix</em> in his namesake’s <em>La vita nuova (The New Life</em>; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state.</p>\n<p>Rossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from <em>La Vita Nuova</em>. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death.

Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted <em>Water Lilies</em>, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether.

The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists.

The 1940s, especially the years 1944–47, marked the creation of his most important work, produced in a kind of stream of consciousness or “automatic” manner of painting. <em>The Plough and the Song</em> reflects the artist’s indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Miró, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are hallmarks of Gorky’s mature work. A delicate contour line delineates the biomorphic forms in the center of the composition, in marked contrast to the loose brushwork that defines the background. The title signals Gorky’s nostalgia for his heritage, as the artist wrote in 1944: “You cannot imagine the fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows. . . .

Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra’s seventh, “immortal” head, which he will later bury.</p>\n<p>Despite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau’s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting.</p>\n<p>Moreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns.

Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>, painted less than a decade later.</p>\n","shortDesc":"Considered Caillebotte’s masterpiece, this view of a busy intersection captures both an everyday moment and all that was new in a rapidly changing Paris.

Van Gogh conceived the first <em>Bedroom</em> in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green.

Nearly fifteen feet tall, this towering work mimics the representations of the political figure that were ubiquitously displayed throughout China.

With little concern for proportion or perspective, the artist depicted fantastic scenes, combining past and present, real and imagined, near and far, which she populated with slim, stylized figures who seem to float or dance through space. In this painting, an ecstatic-looking Thomson, awash in a flood of supernatural light, gazes at a mask bearing Stein’s features, which seems to represent a source of inspiration.

There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.”</p>\n<p>Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like <em>Sunset</em> reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Modernism","placeOfOrigin":"Germany","depicts":"suns,landscapes,orange (color),blue (color),red (color),gold (color),dots,geometric,sky,eyes,faces","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/92da7102-0562-f4da-55f9-1d29828b20d7/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/92da7102-0562-f4da-55f9-1d29828b20d7/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1930","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"46.1 × 70.5 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"1981.182","artist":"Frans Snyders","title":"Still Life with Dead Game, Fruits, and Vegetables in a Market","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>This Flemish market stall overflowing with dead game is enlivened by fighting roosters, an aggressive cat, and a pickpocket.

He painted on a single block with a brush and varying colors; thus, each print is unique. The cobalt-blue striated forms that emanate from the figure’s right and from the side of his head in this print are abstract representations of the painted bands that decorated Kirchner’s studio wall, against which Mueller posed.

It was only then that improved financial circumstances allowed him to give up his successful career as a cartoonist. The setting for this painting is the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Its majestic viaduct became a frequent subject in the artist's drawings starting as early as 1908. His intense interest in architecture, which was to remain constant in Feininger's work, is apparent here not only in the use of the viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored block of houses in the middle ground. It may have been reinforced at this time by his interest in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34225\"> Robert Delaunay</a>'s work, in which architectural subjects likewise plays a primary role.<br>Feininger's early admiration for <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40610\"> Vincent van Gogh</a> seems evident in the heavily impastoed surface and in the use of highly saturated colors, especially yellow, which in the row of houses is beautifully modulated by touches of pink, green, and orange. Also reminiscent of van Gogh are the animated, billowing contours of the houses' rooftops, which in turn echo the sweeping movement of the clouds. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger deployed a motley crew of grotesque and vaguely sinister characters, some of whom recall Feininger's earlier cartoons. With their vividly colored costumes, these figures create a striking counterpoint to the dominant yellow of the background. But the ultimate impression is one of dissonance between the grandeur and beauty of the town's architecture and the bombastic artificiality of its inhabitants.</p>\n<p>—Entry,  Margherita Andreotti, <em>Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies</em>, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 144-145.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Modernism","placeOfOrigin":"United States","depicts":"carnivals,figures (representations),costumes,music,musical instruments,clowns,yellow (color),houses,structures,buildings,bridges,city scenes,towns,celebrations,Joseph Winterbotham Collection","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/63f330b7-1015-96a5-ffa9-f1dbceb354d4/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/63f330b7-1015-96a5-ffa9-f1dbceb354d4/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1911","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"104.8 × 95.9 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"1952.1","artist":"Willem de Kooning","title":"Excavation","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>Willem de Kooning was a central figure in Abstract Expressionism, an art movement that espoused the painterly actions of the artist as a sign of his or her emotions.

Around 1909 Léger began to paint in a Cubist style, although his compositions in this mode are more colorful and curvilinear than works by Braque and Picasso of the same period, with their angular forms and subdued tones. An artist with far-ranging interests and talents, Léger later became a designer for theater, opera, and ballet, as well as a book illustrator, filmmaker, muralist, ceramist, and teacher.</p>\n<p>Typically, Léger would develop a major composition by preparing studies in a variety of media. <em>The Railway Crossing</em> is an oil study for <em>The Level Crossing</em> (1919; private collection, Basel, Switzerland). When he took up this subject in 1919, he made a number of drawings and oil sketches, including the present work. Like many of his contemporaries, Léger was fascinated by the machine age. He maintained that machines and industrial objects were as important to his art as figures. References to such elements pervade <em>The Railway Crossing</em>.

The muse-like image of a woman reading a book was a popular one in nineteenth-century art, but Corot chose to show his model pausing, looking up from this activity. Having spent a number of years in Italy and being a lover of everything Italian, the artist often furnished his models with Italianate costumes such as the one worn here. Whereas Corot’s subject matter is traditional, his technique is not. With direct and bold brushwork, he explored the human form as a construction of masses that support and balance one another.

He also challenged the concept of easel painting by working on canvases placed either on the floor or fixed to a wall.

Although his paintings depict representational imagery, they play heavily upon expressionist distortion, particularly in his use of psychedelic, inharmonious colors. Paschke’s love of urban subcultures and his interest in the underbelly of American society translated into a penchant for sensational subject matter. In his early works, Paschke painted circus freaks and other marginal figures, in marked contrast to, for example, Andy Warhol’s overriding concern with mainstream celebrity. <em>Minnie</em>, which depicts a now-anonymous individual silhouetted against a background of emanating light, is typical of his artistic production from this period.

To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Miró experimented with automatism: “Even a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,” he said, “may suggest the beginning of a picture.” Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the “dream paintings,” which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions.

Bearing the scarification marks of a shaman, he holds in his hand a small jaguar, admired by the Maya as a spiritually powerful creature and a conduit to the underworld.

It was painted by the Chicago Surrealist Gertrude Abercrombie but seems to lack the mysterious imagery of her landscapes and interior scenes. Further examination, however, reveals subtle touches of her dark aesthetic, beginning with the title itself. <em>Self-Portrait of My Sister</em> is an enigmatic reference to a sister who did not exist, for the artist was in fact an only child. However, Abercrombie initially referred to this painting as “Portrait of Artist as Ideal,” a phrase that reveals her underlying meaning. Abercrombie’s work was invariably self-referential; as she put it, “It’s always myself that I paint, but not actually, because I don’t look that good or cute.” Her reference to a fictitious, prettier sister hints at her desire to be a different person, a longing she satisfied through self-portraiture.</p>\n<p>Here, the artist exaggerated and idealized her appearance, depicting herself with an extraordinarily long, slender neck; vivid blue eyes; and sharpened features. She portrayed herself wearing black gloves and a flat-brimmed hat trimmed with a bunch of grapes, all motifs that recurred with some frequency in her paintings and acted as symbols of her presence. Such inclusions helped shape her individual variant of Surrealism, which she felt was based in realism. “Surrealism is meant for me,” she remarked, “because I am a pretty realistic person but don’t like all I see.

This name most likely refers to Daud Khan Panni, a powerful nobleman and a <em>faujdar</em> (a military commander and territorial administrator) who served the Mughal emperors from Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) through Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713–19), in various parts of India. The painting has been dated to 1705/10 and is attributed to the anonymous artist now called the Stipple Master. Working in tandem with his patron Maharana Amar Singh II of Mewar (r. 1698–1710), this artist was the initiator of a new painting style in Mewar in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. A group of about forty-six paintings, including the present work, has now been attributed to this artist-patron duo.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"South Asian","placeOfOrigin":"India","depicts":"monkeys,animals","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/67c7274f-612f-3180-0a12-e2c7ed5a7dd4/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/67c7274f-612f-3180-0a12-e2c7ed5a7dd4/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"c. 1705–1710","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"Outermost border: 48.5 × 58.7 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"2013.4","artist":"Thomas Hart Benton","title":"Cotton Pickers","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>Thomas Hart Benton first saw laborers cultivating cotton on a trip to Georgia in the late 1920s, and he returned to the subject in this painting in 1945.

During the second half of the decade, Whitten began working toward an entirely unique relationship to painting that he described in this way: “About 1965 I wrote on my studio wall one day, the image is photographic; I must photograph my thoughts.” By 1970 the artist had eliminated both expressive color and figuration from his work, launching a ten-year series of paintings that capture, like a camera, the often chance-based immediacies of his dynamic studio process.</p>\n<p><em>Khee II</em> exhibits all the hallmarks of Whitten’s mature process-derived paintings. As with other works from this period, the artist placed a variety of flat, shaped objects beneath the canvas. After preparing the surface with gesso, he layered it with thin sheets of colored Japanese rice paper. The rice paper dissolved, leaving behind pure pigment. Whitten then pulled a rake or other notched tool—which he calls a “developer,” in obvious reference to a photographer’s chemicals—across the work’s surface. This served both to impress the shapes from below, effectively embossing the canvas, and to disperse color on top of it. The result is a series of ghostlike images and alternating rows of color that vibrate with subtle luminosity.

In this work, Tai captures that principle movement—atmospheric forces clashing and meteorites surging through mist and clouds—and organically merges the classical conception of the cosmos with his distinctively expressive style. The result is spontaneous, mysterious, but above all, beautiful.</p>\n<p>A scholar of art history and theory, Tai has asserted that “to present landscape painting that meets modern tastes, we must start from the experience of modern society—by properly accessing the living spirit of art, researching the materials, techniques, medium, and modern time-space experience. In short, we should not only keep alive traditional art, but also the tradition of art.”</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Chinese (culture or style),21st Century","placeOfOrigin":null,"depicts":"motion","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/fd6deeb9-6d01-3849-17d5-a7cbf89f8e3f/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/fd6deeb9-6d01-3849-17d5-a7cbf89f8e3f/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"2014","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"139.1 × 294.6 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"2016.62","artist":"Chung, Sang-Hwa","title":"Untitled 72–12–A","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>Chung Sang-Hwa’s signature technique entails a repetitive process of applying and then removing paint, so that each work comprises both positive and negative space, with raw canvas as much a part of its structure as the paint itself. Considered representative of the Korean Tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Chung’s works are thus defined not by any single choice of color but instead by how they were made. Indeed, many products of the movement were referred to as <em>pangbop</em>—“methods” — rather than as paintings; the centrality of method or process led Korean art critic Yi Kyung-Sung to describe Tansaekhwa works in terms of drawing with, spreading, bleeding, spilling, and pushing paint, for instance.</p>\n<p><em>Untitled, 72-12-A</em> is one of Chung’s key transitional works, among the first in which he initially employed uniform, allover applications of paint before then peeling and scraping some of it away. The resulting canvas was then covered from edge to edge by two different kinds of marks: those that remain from the first white coats and the similarly sized “strokes” made by pulling paint away. These latter gestures sometimes expose the loosely woven brown canvas support and at other times reveal underlayers of different white paints—some matte, some shiny, some off-white, and some faintly yellow. The large scale of this simultaneously random and exacting composition raises issues of labor, intensity, and intention. At the same time, the very idea of a composition is thrown into question: Chung filled his canvas evenly and without emphasis, often shifting it as he worked in order to ensure a kind of noncompositional unity across the entire field of the painting.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Tansaekhwa,Dansaekhwa","placeOfOrigin":null,"depicts":"patterns","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/86f8596f-6fc2-5f28-dc26-8526b5da2290/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/86f8596f-6fc2-5f28-dc26-8526b5da2290/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1972","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"162 × 130 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"2016.66","artist":"Wanda Pimentel","title":"Involvement Series","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>Wanda Pimentel emerged as an important young artist within Brazil’s 1960s New Figuration movement. This was a Pop Art–inflected turn to representational painting as a form of sardonic commentary on and resistance to a number of forces—a dictatorial government, the rise of consumer culture in parallel with a rise in urban poverty, and, in Pimentel’s case specifically, the stereotypes and constraints imposed on women by a patriarchal society.</p>\n<p>Pimentel began her decade-long <em>Involvement Series</em> around 1965; as she put it a few years later, “My studio is in my bedroom. Everything has to be very neat. . . . I work alone. I think my issues are the issues of our time: the lack of perspective for people, their alienation. The saddest thing is for people to be dominated by things.” Rendered in a vivid but reduced palette and a flat, graphic style, these early works hint at intimate, mundane scenes. They depict domestic objects in enigmatic, compressed interiors and suggest acts of corresponding domestic labor, always implying—if not always representing—a woman’s body. When pictured, this body is fragmented—a leg or a pair of feet rather than a fully legible form. In this 1968 canvas, for example, a pair of feet peek out from below the horizon-like line of a red ironing board. The owner of these feet is otherwise only indicated by a rack of blouses and by the ready iron: the trappings of stereotyped female labor and identity.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"contemporary","placeOfOrigin":null,"depicts":"clothing,irons (tools),red (color),blue (color),white (color),black (color)","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/0f6ffedf-d080-9528-9543-31087899ce57/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/0f6ffedf-d080-9528-9543-31087899ce57/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1968","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"130 × 98 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"2016.15","artist":"Sebastiano del Piombo","title":"Christ Carrying the Cross","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>This painting represents one of the most popular compositions invented by one of the most distinguished painters working in Rome during the High Renaissance. In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian Giorgio Vasari stated that “first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.”</p>\n<p><em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"","placeOfOrigin":null,"depicts":"Jesus,crucifixions,crosses,biblical","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/13a251ba-2c7a-2d0c-3f65-820c0e1f1a39/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/13a251ba-2c7a-2d0c-3f65-820c0e1f1a39/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"about 1515/1517","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"118 × 92 cm "},{"inventoryNumber":"2016.46","artist":"Georg Scholz","title":"Small Town by Day (Badische Kleinstadt bei Tage)","artworkType":"Painting","description":"<p>A leading practitioner of <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em> (New Objectivity), Georg Scholz was among a group of young German artists who lived through the cruelty of frontline battle in World War I and returned home to find a weakening economy and mounting political and social problems. They felt that the ills of society were best exposed through the meticulously painted realism, which evoked Germany’s past. Combining historical style with images of the nation’s present-day situation, Scholz’s paintings offer a biting critique of the new Weimar Republic’s political and social shortcomings.</p>\n<p><em>Small Town by Day</em> is a case in point. At the top of the canvas we are reminded of the mythic ideals of Germany: faith (a priest and the cross of a church illuminated by the sky), family (the woman pushing the carriage and a group of geese walking in an orderly line), the country’s great heritage (the bust of Frederick the Great), and national symbols (an inn called the German Oak). Further down, however, a cold clarity reveals the inner workings of a fictional town in the region of Baden. Nestled within the cozy buildings and streets, we see a cast of characters and the hypocrisy they represent. A puffed-up officer in uniform walks proudly while a wounded vet hobbles in the other direction, a bloated butcher squeezes clean the intestines of a pig as he holds a bloody knife in his mouth, a young boy scoops manure from a horse-drawn hearse, and an elderly woman walks to an outhouse. Scholz’s clear vision lays bare the base and at times sordid activities of a seemingly idyllic setting.</p>\n","shortDesc":null,"isHighlight":true,"artMovement":"Modernism","placeOfOrigin":null,"depicts":"towns,animals,horses,birds","primaryImageSmall":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/cd773e50-2f0f-9d5d-e112-a5271164abf2/full/843,/0/default.jpg","primaryImageOriginal":"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/cd773e50-2f0f-9d5d-e112-a5271164abf2/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","artworkDate":"1922–23","museum":"The Art Institute of Chicago","dimension":"99.7 × 74.3 cm "}]
